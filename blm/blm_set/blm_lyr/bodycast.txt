There's nothing going on here. And you are violating my rights, sweetheart. Now, tell me that I'm fucking wrong. You can't 'cause I'm not wrong. You violating my rights as a⁠— shut up! Shut your mouth!. You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something. You heard me talking. I talk loud and I'm aggressive. And guess what? You did not knock on my door. [Verse 1]. Lately I had passed on mine. County ain't on shit, they got bodies on the line. Lately I've been analyzing time. Y'all been dodging cameras like they bullets over crime. Lately all my rations turned to wine. Throwing back them bottles 'til our traumas all align. Lately I've been coughing up the rhymes. Throwing middle fingers like they hopping number 9. . [Chorus]. Bitch, I never said it, nah, I never said it. Nah, I never, nah, I never said it. Snitch and you'll regret it, switching up the setting. Stitch upon my lips, I know you read it. Bitch, I never said it, no, I never said it. No, I never, no, I never said it. Snitch and you'll regret it, switching up the setting. Stitch upon my lips, you never read it. . [Verse 2]. Ghost in a shell, put your penny in a well. Iron out my organs 'til my body starts to swell. Ghost in a shell, put your pain into the well. Iron out your organs 'til your body starts to swell. Catch me in the morning, I be seething. Meter run on feeling. Fawning on them folk, I know they fiending. Funny you ain't seen it. Look across the porch, it's almost scenic. Fiber on my chest, it's orthopedic. You might also like[Chorus]. Bitch, I never said it, no, I never said it. Nah, I never, nah, I never said it. Snitch, you might regret it, switching up the setting. Stitch upon your lips, you know I read it. Bitch, I never said it, no, I never said it. No, I never, no, I never said it. Snitch and you'll regret it, switching up the setting. Stitch upon your lips, I know you read it. . [Outro]. I know my rights. They cannot walk in my home. 'Cause if this door was closed, they would've had to knock. Don't ever do that again, thank youEmbed
