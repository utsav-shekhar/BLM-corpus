We're down to die, down to die. . [Chorus: Drew]. You know we're down to shoot, but all ya' gotta do is say when. Baby, skip the conversation. You know we're down to shoot, but all ya' gotta do is say when. Baby, skip the conversation. . [Verse 2: Drew]. I got this shit from my grandfather. These politic niggas some scam artists. Call it the land of the free, but that shit ain't for me. We'll go out like some damn martyrs. Watch how THEY. shove all that money way deep in my pockets and tell me to stop it. Do what you do, yeah, that's cool, but for me being neutral was never an option!. We never shy from the drama (shy from the drama!). I used to swim with piranhas (where the piranhas at!). I put that shit on my mama (onto my mama!). Which one you bitches would run up?. They'll shoot at my brothers and let 'em fall. And then we some thugs if we get involved?. Fuck you and ya' system, you killin' my niggas. And you think we 'bout to just let you off?. (Fuck that, pull up!). You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Drew]. You or me. I'll go first.
