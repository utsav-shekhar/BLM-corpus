Toomp is on the beat. . "Do your job. Do what you say this country is supposed to be about. 'The land of the free for all'. It has not been free for black people. And we are tired". . [Intro]. DJ Toomp. Burn this bitch. We goin' burn this. We goin' burn this bitch. [Chorus]. Tell the pastor he can't tell me shit. We goin' burn this bitch. Fuck these crackers and and they fucking flag. Raise your black fist. . Tell Kap he can take a knee. But we don't kneel for shit. Get the gas and your fucking mask. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. . [Post-Chorus]. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. . We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. . [Verse 1: Noochie]. Eh, someone please call 911, we can ambush they ass. They will never set it coming. Fuck putting your hands up, they kill us in handcuffs. Unarmed, but he yelled, "We got a handgun". They want niggas at the bottom forever. This shit ain't new, been a problem forever. Pops got 12, ain't touched nobody. Nigga fuck 12, they don't love nobody. Fuck all that marchin', we gettin' armed up. I'm tryin' to be peaceful, but they woke the monster. I'm thinking arson, I'm 'bout to bomb 'em. They never listened, but we tried to warn 'em. Fuck it then get the strap, we loot then they shoot. Then we shoot 'em back. Polluting my people with noose and crack. Only way out is to hoop and rap. Eh, fuck is a blue life?. Someone that's corrupt and don't do right?. Someone that's goin' make sure the noose tight?. A pussy in badge and some blue tights?. Just made it out the academy. Take a father out of his family. Driving a mama to insanity. Fuck a flag, give a fuck who mad at me. Black man and I won't be a casualty. You might also like[Verse 2: Torae]. Burn this bitch down if we need to. Keep on harming my people. Since being black is illegal. We don't see change, we goin' see you. 'Til you see through, three-fifths is not equal. Tryin' to live, shit is lethal. Man, fuck thst flag and that eagle. I ain't turn it down 'til we turn it 'round. You ain't know, well you learnin' now. Paid with our lives so we earnin' now. Built it up and we'll burn it down. Let the po-po know that I'm in the town. Loaded rounds for the bonus rounds. All the Sandra Blands, all the Michael Browns. Heart beat pound when the sirens sound. What my kids goin' do if I'm not around?. When I'm handcuffed and they beat me down?. Knee on my neck, and I'm on the ground. Gasping for air is a scary sound. So I stay strapped when I ride around. 17 shots to divide around. Better riot wild, look my body found. Silenced too long to be quiet now. . [Verse 3: David Banner]. Mama cryin' in the kitchen. I ain't marchin' with no Christians. Tell the preacher if he comin'. Bring a fuckin' pistol with him. I'm sick of prayers and good wishes. From you pussy-ass rappers. You a gangsta in the hood. But you scared of these crackers. Grab some rope, drumma get the dope. We about to smoke. Get the stick with extendo clips. We goin' hit the road. Fuck this pig, he knows what he did. Take me to his crib. Kick his door, split his fucking wig. I hope he hid the kids. They done gentrified all the projects. To put their knees off on our necks. Now the whole world wanna protest. They put rubber bullets off in my chest. That's a whole lot for me to digest. That's a lot of pain with no progress. Give me justice, or give me death. Imma burn it down before I rest. [Verse 4: Cyhi the Prynce]. Fuck all you yellow journalists. And yeah that's permanent. Nat Turner shit, we goin' burn this bitch. Like General Sherman did. Ain't that the truth? Like Sojourner is. We lit like furnaces. Serving bricks like it's '36. From here to Ferguson. Turn this bitch into ashes nigga. We goin' earn this shit. Got my rifle, vest, and tourniquet. That's what I'm purging with. All my actions are affirmative. Another murder victim to the system. Call Geico or whoever y'all insurance with. 'Cause my peoples built this country. Damn near furnished it. So fuck your constitution. Nigga, what's your contribution?. Bitch, we done with lootin'. Guns are shootin' from the roof. And some is boostin,' join the movement. School of hard knocks honor students. . [Verse 5: Ras Kass]. No peace rallies, no interventions. A nigga jaywalk, gets sent to prison. Arrests ain't enough, we demand convictions. And a long-ass prison sentence. Numbers like price of retro Nikes. 200 years, four strikes. Justice ain't alike for blacks and whites. Unite, grab your strap and fight. These children of the dogs that hung us from shade trees. Same greed sold our babies into slavery. Cave beast won't save me. Burn it all down into flames please. We angry, let's do it for Selma. We can't breathe, let's do it for Tulsa. Self-defense from the Klan and the Karens. Fuck y'all culture vultures. Power respect power. The wolf don't get permission from the sheep (facts). Stranglehold, we can't breathe. Our leaders suggesting peace. Either you sleep afraid or a house negro. The elite don't protect the people. Actors ain't there, rappers got scared. Happy to eat by their massas' feet though. Racist crackers is black cancer. We don't believe you, we got cameras. Need the Panthers. Cut the head off the Grand Dragon. Bring me the antlers. . [Verse 6: Pastor Troy]. Okay, I'm goin' burn your where it hurt. I'm goin make you go to work. Clean this motherfucker up. 'Cause we 'bout to tear it up. PT cruiser have got my ruger. Pastor of the movement. We don't want to tear it up. But, bitch, we need improvement. Lost my best friend to the police brutality. Everybody wanna march but this is my reality. This is not a photo op. I can't stand the fucking cops. Pullin' me over. This one's for my soldiers. Got a lot of officers that really protect me. But there's way more that can't wait to disrespect me. So let me tell you how we feelin' right now. Police killing black men so I'm tellin' y'all right now. . [Chorus: David Banner]. Tell the pastor he can't tell me shit. We goin' burn this bitch. Fuck these crackers and they fucking flag. Raise your black fist. Tell Kap he can take a knee. But we don't kneel for shit. Get the gas and your fucking mask. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. . [Post-Chorus: David Banner & Pastor Troy]. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. We goin' burn this bitch. Goin' burn this bitch. Burn this bitch. . [Outro]. Hey yeah, boy. Hey yeah. Hey yeah, boy. Hey yeah. "We're not thugs. I see beautiful people out here. I see kings and queens. I see activists, I see passionate people. I see mothers, fathers, sons, daughters. I see a people who say, 'We ain't goin' for it no more. If we got to burn this motherfucker down. That's what they goin;' do'. They ain't calling for it no more"Embed
