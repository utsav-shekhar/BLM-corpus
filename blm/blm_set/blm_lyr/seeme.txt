Ooh, mmm. . [Verse 1]. Walking, talking to myself. What's the use of talking if no one is listening?. Praying, praying to myself. What's the use of asking if no one is answering?. . [Chorus]. Can you hear me, now?. Can you see me, now?. If I cry out, love, will you believe me, now?. [Verse 2]. Crying, crying to myself. What's the use of trying if everyone thinks we're wrong?. Well, I'll keep singing it, singing to myself. Hoping that somebody, they're gonna sing along. Help me sing this song. . [Chorus]. Can you hear me, now?. Can you see me, now?. If I cry out, love, will you believe me, now?. Can you hear me, now?. Can you see me, now?. If I cry out, love, will you believe me, now?You might also likeEmbed
