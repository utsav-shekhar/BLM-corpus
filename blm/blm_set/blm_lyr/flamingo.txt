How many shrimps do you have to eat. Before you make your skin turn pink?. Eat too much and you'll get sick. Shrimps are pretty rich. . [Verse 1]. なんであいつらはピンク？. 動物園で思ったピンク. 食べ物でそうなんだ. 実は私はたらこが大好き. プラス海老カニ食べよう. ピンク色になるの？. だから皆違う色. 人間って勘違いしてるよね. [Chorus]. Black, white, green or blue. Show off your natural hue. Flamingo, oh, oh, oh. If you're multicolored, that's cool too. You don't need to change. It's boring being the same. Flamingo, oh, oh, oh. You're pretty either way. . [Verse 2]. 鶴の嘴下に向かって曲げたらフラミンゴ. 意味不明だけど　面白いでしょ. 虹色に染まった世界. 今日も地球のどこかで. 海老をむしゃむしゃ食べて. フラミンゴはピンク色に. 染まっていくぜ one, two, three. . [Chorus]. Black, white, green or blue. Show off your natural hue. Flamingo, oh, oh, oh. If you're multicolored, that's cool too. You don't need to change. It's boring being the same. Flamingo, oh, oh, oh. You're pretty either way. Flamingo.
