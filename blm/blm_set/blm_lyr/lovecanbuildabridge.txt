I'd gladly walk across the desert. With no shoes upon my feet. To share with you the last bite. Of bread I had to eat. I would swim out to save you. In your sea of broken dreams. When all your hopes are sinkin'. Let me show you what love means. . [Chorus]. Love can build a bridge. Between your heart and mine. Love can build a bridge. Don't you think it's time?. Don't you think it's time?. [Verse 2]. I would whisper love so loudly. Every heart could understand. That love and only love. Can join the tribes of man. I would give my heart's desire. So that you might see. The first step is to realize. That it all begins with you and me. . [Chorus]. Love can build a bridge. Between your heart and mine. Love can build a bridge. Don't you think it's time?. Don't you think it's time?. . [Bridge]. When we stand together. It's our finest hour. We can do anything, anything. Keep believin' in the power. . [Chorus]. Love can build a bridge. Between your heart and mine. Love can build a bridge. Don't you think it's time?. Don't you think it's time?. Yeah, yes I do. Oh. You might also like[Chorus]. Love can build a bridge (Oh, love and only love). Between your heart and mine (Between your heart and mine). Love can build a bridge (Love and only love). Don't you think it's time?. Oh, don't you think it's time?. . [Outro]. Love and only love. Love and only love1Embed
