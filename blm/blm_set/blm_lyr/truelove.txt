Love is a memory. And in these last days, when iniquity blazing. Truth Love Speaks. . [Chorus:]. I need true love. Do you know what you mean to me (true love). Does it show as I live and I breath (true love). In the valley of the shadow, I know you'll be. I defense, I conquer death. I conquer the enemy (envy). [Verse 2].

That's like a preacher who only respects sunday morning, and not saturday night. That's how a soldier can come to reflect. That Love is more than a man and a wife, i mean. . [Chorus:].

When I n' I cup is full, yeah. Jah keep I from their temptation. . [Chorus:]. I need true love. Do you know what you do it to me (true love). Does it show as I live and I breath (true love). In the valley of the shadow, I know you'll be. I defense, I conquer death. I conquer the enemyYou might also like3Embed
