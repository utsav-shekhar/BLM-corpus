When Babylon a forward any numbers can play. Simple calculation ghetto youth equal slay. The city it’s a cage and poverty is a chain. And when you study the case. A still slavery days. I study Malcolm X and I listen to Shango. I'm a reggae John Lennon. Me nah follow no Rambo. This a one story that ever goes wrong. Deh pan the charts without singing a song. A one tree many roots. Branches and leaves so I vision the youths. In the world weh we live. The abusing amuse me confuse me. I refuse the idea. Executed by on and off duty so!. . [Chorus] [2x]. Calm down listen to the waves. Relax and puff some grade. Officer sir remove your shades. Justice served. Change your way !. . [Verse 2]. Them fi protect and serve. Instead a test we nerves. Ink over nine still I choose my words. It’s a striking game like hungry birds. So a next murder-ration is on the verge. . Fake media talking. Racial confrontation are spiking. Forever nemesis like Christian and Vikings. So what I see don’t surprise me. It’s a new dawn a new rising. You might also like[Chorus] [2x]. Calm down listen to the waves. Relax and puff some grade. Officer sir remove your shades. Justice served. Change your ways!. . [Verse 3]. Waiting the clash between oppressed on oppressors. Waving the flag it’s a new misconception. Here comes the youth fighting every oppression. Open the mic set up new session. Confined between lanes based on completion. Native reserves at every intersection. City like lock ups them call it ghetto. Them choose to degrade us more than respect us . . [Chorus] [2x]. Calm down listen to the waves. Relax and puff some grade. Officer sir remove your shades. Justice served. Change your ways!Embed
