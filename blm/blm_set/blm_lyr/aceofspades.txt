On every Body Count album. We like to pay homage and tribute to a. Group that motivated and inspired our sound. On this album, we're sending a shout out to Lemmy. Rest in peace, from Motorhead. . [Verse 1]. If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man. You win some, you lose some, it's all the same to me. The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say. I don't share your greed, the only card I need. [Chorus]. Is the ace of spades. The ace of spades. . [Verse 2]. Playing with the high one, dancing with the devil. Going with the flow, it's all a game to me. Seven or eleven, snake eyes watching you. Double up or quit, double stake or split. . [Chorus]. The ace of spades. The ace of spades. . [Bridge]. You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools. But that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever. And don't forget the joker. . [Verse 3]. Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me. Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again. I see it in your eyes, take one look and die. The only thing you see, i know it's gonna be. . [Chorus]. The ace of spades. The ace of spadesYou might also likeEmbed
