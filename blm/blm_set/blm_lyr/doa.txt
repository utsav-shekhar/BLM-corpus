Shadows infect the white-clad walls. Death is breathing down your neck. You try to flee. . Forced into submission. You try to repent. A strip of tape that kills the screams. You know this is the end. . Surgical steel, twist the flesh. The hand of doom carves out the mesh. DOA!. What more when you're dead on arrival?!. What more when you're dead on arrival?!. . Doped-up soul, senses numb. Fluids burst into flames. Every high is a new low. In these vermin-infested streets. Chained to the Altar of Debt. The breed of your sins. Nailed to the cross of guilt. The spawn of your greed. . A strip of tape that kills the screams. A deed inspired, the circle's complete. . DOA!. What more when you're dead on arrival?.
