Somebody's drivin' you home, but they don't know who you are. You're in the back of the car. Somebody's tryin' to help and makin' everything worse. Somebody, please call the nurse. Somebody's rippin' you off, tryin' to sell you good news. You know we're still gonna lose. But I need to be where you are, for no reason at all. Or else I'll suffer withdrawals. . [Chorus]. Nobody's comin' to save me. Nobody knows any better, anyway. I think we're thinkin' the same thing. If this is how it ends, I wasn't listening. [Verse 2]. Somebody's scrеamin' again. Another sunburn with hair, it's too much fun not to stare. Somebody's callin' you out for somеthin' you never said. Kinda can't wait to be dead. Somebody's wasting my time. Fuck your Confederate flag, you've got no reason to brag. . [Chorus]. Nobody's comin' to save me. Nobody knows any better, anyway. I think we're thinkin' the same thing. If this is how it ends, I wasn't listening (To you). (To you). . [Outro]. I wasn't listening yet. Not even gone, but you'll be missing me yet. I wasn't listening yet. I wasn't listening. I wasn't listening yetYou might also like8Embed
