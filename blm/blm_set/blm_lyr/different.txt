I love me, I love me enough for the both of us. That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us. . [Verse]. You used to text me about a hundred words. Now it seems as if we live in two different worlds. Baby it's cool, you can go now. But don't lie to the next guy and say I broke your heart, nah. Nothing Was The Same by Graham Dreezy. Used to put this song on repeat whenever you kick it with me. You were a good cook, used to do macaroni. Until you switched up, all you bought was pepperoni. I guess love fades at some point in life. I really hate it when you tell me how to live my life. Used to express feels at 2AM. Found out you got another hitta, you got two great men. You cut me off 'cause of the distance?. We could've make it work, stop bringing out that nonsense. It's fine yes, do what you gotta do. I ain't the childish type, on social media I ain't blocking you. 4AM in my room, as I type WhatsApping you. Like "baby, what I do?". Sometimes I'm in the booth and all I think is you. Like "what happened man?". I'm sorry if I didn't treat you the way you wanted. I just thought I did things the way you wanted. I tried my best I guess it wasn't good enough. Shout out to the new guy, I hope he gon' treat you right. Yeah, but baby girl what you want?. I still believe in us, let's give it another try. But you got that look in your eyes. That you giving up and there's no longer us. I I guess I'm sick of this. The one you love the most always does stupid things. But I need to thank you right now. You made me a better person, so you gotta be proud. [Sample]. I love me, I love me enough for the both of us. That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us. . [Skit].
