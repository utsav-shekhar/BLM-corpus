Oh shit, I guess we're starting. The mic is where my heart is. I know what my part is. I hear my own voice. I make my own choice. I guess, we're fuckin' doing it. The horse is out the gates. It's time to start the race. Shoutout to Kathy Bates and also Betty White. All the people, if you're the type. I wanna say that you're equal on the mic. But nobody's equal to me. Nobody is coming for my neck. I am looking for respect. I'm not looking for a check. Unless it is for my friends. That's why we're doing this. To make some pennies. And maybe make amends. Sailors in the sea might get the bends. That is my fuckin' dream. To go with James Cameron in a submarine. To the bottom of the ocean. Rocking forth with the motion. Me and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion. Sharing our emotion. Daring you to fuck with us. At the sea, at a deep water vent. But we don't got the bends, we're not bent. I think that's what I'm meant to do. Me and my crew. Gigantic, looking to cross the sea. For the Titanic. Oh shit, you mean they found it?. Already? They'd abounded with treasure?. Man, that doesn't give me pleasure. I don't know how to measure. How I feel about that shit. But that won't make me quit. In my quest, to scour the deep sea. Like, you and me?. Searching for an angle, mangled. The corpse in the Bermuda Triangle. Maybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane. We're like "oh, shit, what remains". And. Then we get to the bottom. Amelia Earhart's like "oh, shit, got em!". You didn't know, but I was an immortal. I just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal. Shuffled off my fucking mortal coil. Mortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil. All my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal. And you know, I am not gonna take a foil. To my head in a little tin cap shape. Because you know I'm great. I popped the grape. But I'm not on some conspiracies. I'm just trying to see what's up in the seas. I believe that I will not cease and desist. You cannot resist. When I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist. I am in Manila, in Hong Kong. In San Francisco, doing a disco. Pop it hot like it's Crisco. But I gotta pace myself. If we're gonna raise this wealth. That's why I flow at this tempo. Hello, I do kempo. In my mind, that's a form of martial arts. But I take, partial starts. And I just gave little partial farts. When I'm shitting on the mic. 'Cause you know I got this heart. And you know I got the K-Mart. State-of-the-art mind. But I'm not be-hind. No, I'm way out in the front. Rolling up a 30-foot blunt. And you know I'm not gonna bunt. In a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger. Because I am the rap ringer. I never make the wrong call. And you know, chicks dig the long ball!. I am like (Ah). They are like (Wow). Watsky, you cannot stop me. I got no paparazzi. I'm a fucking doorstep. I'm gonna take one more step. And then, take another. Word, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'. Here I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada. Just keep rappin', yada yada yada. Hey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld. Me and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld. Or maybe it's more like Larry David. Because you know we're not playing. Shoutout to the Jews, the chosen people. You know that you cannot fuckin' lose. But also, shoutout to the Christians. Shoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions. You know you cannot stop it. Also, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith. Who know we're gonna make way. For the Jehovah's Witnesses. They got their hit list-esses. Walking up to the different fuckin' doors. Saying "Would you like to love God a little more?". But it kinda sucks, just because of COVID. They can't be making no bids. I heard they're not doing that door-knockin'. But, you know, we're not stoppin'. However you appraise 'em. No, we are fuckin' raising. On the mic I'm fuckin' blazing. If the sun is blazing. I turn into a raisin. I'm bringing this whole craze. For almost two whole days. I don't think that's possible. I don't think that's wise. I don't think that's probable. That is what they say when they look in to my eyes. My momma was afraid for me. She busted in like the maître d. She said "Hello umm". I don't think you wanna sit here. I don't think you wanna get here. 'Cause you might die. You know but then I was like "I gotta try". I gotta try to do the right thing. Shoutout to Spike Lee. I'm gonna try to get the ring. Try to get the bling. Try to be the king of the long raps. Like I was the dude with the ass raps. Doesn't matter. As long as the people fuckin' clap. As long as we give a little joy. Give em dat'. Then I will cut the crap. I guess I am a believer. And I don't care that I got seizures. I got my fuckin' pills. I'm gonna take 'em right around midnight. So I can get right. I think that's what I gotta do. Shout out to the medical commun-. Itty I just get gritty. I hope my rhymes are not shitty. Umm, mic check are you with me?. Shout-out Bobby and Whitney. But not shout out to the bad things he did. I don't know if I'm gonna have a kid. I don't know if I'm gonna raise a child. But it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild. They would make be fuckin' smile. They got fuckin' bile and some guts. Everybody does. Everybody got guts. Everybody got nuts. Or half the people maybe like 48.7%. That's about how it went. I think that is the percentage-ish. Of the gender fuckin' separation. Although we know in this nation. Things are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient. If you don't understand. I got my fuckin' rhymes on demand. I can run it back. But I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness. If I'm trying to fuckin' win this. I will not get winded, I have not rescinded. Anything that I've fucking said. By the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead. I'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds. That is like Right Said Fred. You just gotta relax. If you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe. I don't get lyrical cataracts. So I can see clearly, so I can be dearly. Received, I've got to achieve. Whatever I've got up my sleeve. Whatever I've got in my pouch. Shoutout to pouch, ouch. I pricked my finger, that is not true. But on this mic I will linger for you. And for my crew. This is what I've got to do. I've got to drop it hot for you. 'Cause this is why I'm hot. This is why I'm not. Shoutout to Mims. Shoutout to Hims. That's that brand of underwear. That I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway. I'm drivin' down the one way. I'm cruisin' up the runway. Spreading my wings. Like I am a Cessna. Like I am a chestnut. Roastin' on an open fire, bing!. Crosby, you got me. Me, hot see?. Me Watsky. See?. Sittin' in the hot seat. No, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat. But that word, beats droppin' me. And meha coppin'. Shoutout to Frank Macoppin. Playground. In the fuckin' San Francisco SFC. Because you know how this go. We are the best in Dolores Park. We have a chorus singin' in the dark. Hark, the angel. Shoutout to Chuck Rangel. Rangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but. In December maybe I will be dismembered. By a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa. Comin' down my chimney. Wavin' fuckin' butcher knives. That’d be fucking crazy. Who is he. Who is this robotic crazy Santa. Oh my ‘lanta. I can’t believe that he’s tryna get me. Instead of giving me presents. I can't believe that he got me on the ground. But I'm like "no I'm Watsky". And Santa said "oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude". But I'm like "that's rude. Santa you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'. Plus I was in the nude. He got me tackled on the ground. My fuckin' whole brood around me. And I got my whole butt out. He's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away. Cut-out. Cut it out like on Full House. John Stamos. John Stains-Most in his pants. But that's okay. We don't judge people who like to dance away the day. If they need a Pepto-Bismol. My throat is not abysmal. This all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt. I will not repent. And I’m not demented. But I meant it. When I sent it. From my brain. I'm not plain. Im not fuckin' around. I’m not cluckin' the ground. Just right there it’s only two feet. That’s pretty cool man I eat. From that cup right there. The one that’s floatin' up in the air. It’s got a fuckin' strawber-. -ry smoothie. I flow very smoothly. But you cannot do me. Do me, do me like that. I got that roomie type rap. It’s mad philosophical. I just keep on droppin' all. Of the marbles in my brain. They’re comin' out my nose. And then they just remain. On the ground. Even the cat’s eye. That is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by. Did you know at places. People on the internet watch marble races. I watched one. It was mad fun. I picked the fuckin' blue marble. And my pick wasn't all garbled. It came down the shoot. It was going all fuckin' cool. And then it fuckin scooted past the red one. That kid from The Shining like Red-Rum. Meaning murder. Worder. Wordier. All my flows are so dirtier. Than you could even fuckin' guess. I'm not even fucking stressed. I'm so damn relaxy. Shout out to a Maxi-Pad. For being so absorbent. That's a good fuckin' fuction. My girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it. Put her hands in the air. Maxi Pads doing what they do down there. If you are shaved or if you've got hair. It doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare. Do what you wanna. Word to your mama. Your dude can't tell you what you gotta do. Gotta do what you wanna. Make your own choice. With your body or your voice. If you are moist. I know some people don't like that word. Palabra. But you know you gotta like what you like. There was this one time this dude named Ike. Ran to be Prez. And he fuckin' won. Eisenhower, that's what I said. I's a power-rapper. Yes I am. So fuckin' dapper. The clapper. Doesn't work on the lights on this green screen. Man, that would be a dream scene. If I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want. What I want, damn. That would be no scam. I don't eat no Spam. That's 'cause I am a soft boy. And I only eat Bok-Choy. 'Cause I'm a little veggie human. And that's what I be doin'. Let me clarify. Like clarified butter. Again, word to your mother. And also not to digress. But I gotta get it off of my chest. Word to Mark Wahlberg. Word to ballers. Wait, okay, let me make my main point. As I rap over this joint. And that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy. I also eat soy. I also as a Jewish type dude not a goy. Get lots of joy out of eatin' carrots. Out of eatin' broccoli. Out of eatin' lots of trees. Out of smokin' lots of trees. That is true. That is not. I don't smoke a lot. But I do when I party. But during COVID, I party hardly. And I guess that's kinda sad. But I've had some calls with my dad. Paul Watsky. And Claire Watsky. It's rare, stop me. It's not, lots of Sundays. I call my parentals. And I just steal out my fuckin' mentals. But I don't pull out my dentals. I go sometimes I do in a dream. When I am on the scene. And the ghost come and make me scream. It's like you are doing the most. And I gotta fuckin' boast. Shout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast. That is some shit if you take a gander. That was said by Mr. Ned Flanders. Mr. Homer Simpson. I'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on. They're like “Watsky, I'll do everything for you. I'll white knight for you and your fucking crew”. I'm like “Dude, don't be a simp. Actually, DO be a simp. You could be pimp. You could be wimp. You could fucking walk with a limp. You can have a crimp in your dimp-le”. I just get the whole tent pole. Up in the sky cause I meant. Lots of people can come in. Cause I got a big tent. So if you are a lame. Fucking get bent. And by lame, what I mean in this game. Is the type of person who says that you're lame. Is the type of person who judges. Is the type of person who never budges. When they get stubborn. Cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard. [?] 00:18:04. Word!. I think I got this whole thing turn-ed up. But that is bound to happen. 34 hours when you keep on rappin'. Some words are going to collide like trains. Coming head to head, but it remains. To be seen that I get back on the track. With the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*. With my fucking clapping gums. So don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb. Sometimes. Cause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes. But it happens and I think that is the lesson. That you cannot achieve perfection. And it's not even a worthy goal. You just gotta try to put that ball in the hole. More times than not. This is why I'm hot, as I said. But, you know Man's Not Hot?. Although the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am. 'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham. On the microphone-o oh no. Can't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno. Ice skatin' all over the beat. Makin' it repeat. I do not want to beat my meat, on the camera. That would be a bad fuckin' PR move. When I'm all up in the groove with my meat out. They would be like "oh, shout out. That will ruin my career. Is that fuckin' clear?. Showin' his whole rear?. He got fuckin' nakey. Make me, take me. You cannot bake me. In my EZ bake oven. No Sara Lee. I just keep on flowing, so merrily. Verily, forsooth, did he do that shit. Oh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it. He's just Frank Coppin it. And there is no halting' it. I just put some fuckin malt in it. Make it like some Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!. Did you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed. [00:20:00]. 'Cause you could not rhyme. Like I do, do the crime and you know that I'm. Just puttin' lime on top of this shit. And that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me. 'Cause you know when I put it on top. That I am going to make it drop. To the bottom of the urinal. You're all in my brain. And I'm hearing y'all. But I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments. I be too scared to see the tools. But I got to just remain bold. And I've got to stay in the hold. My whole nuts life, oh, my nuts. Remember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?. Remember jungle?. [00:20:41]. . [00:30:00]. They got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate. Verbally, vocally, stoking the fire. Of the couress I retired. I feel one year. 'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear. See how I could sing, that took many years. Before I try to do with the din. And now I only rapped. And now I only try to cap, no cap. I just try to get that back. That back, uh, back. And I'm gone. Over the fence. No shout out to my pens. . You know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda. . [00:40:00]. I'm sittin' on the veranda. Just sippin' on my water. Lookin' at my ink blotter. Feelin' like the best. Starin' at my Rorschach test. And it's tellin' me some dark crap. It's tellin' some star type of stuff. Like oh shit, I'm gruff. I'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff. Scruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois. 6-0-6-5-2 that I'm. You might also like(00:44:22). You know that a bat kills. Using sonar. Going through the cave. With the lights pulsing like it is a rave.

On the motorbike. That pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike. It was really scary. I didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me. To, but I said that that video was too weird. A monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly. A weird type of simian. Type of chimpanzee, I don't know which one. It was, it was in Jakarta, I think?. I don't know what type of the rink. Of this world that I skate. I repeat that I'm late. To the party. But that means that partly I gotta go hardy. Hardly, not like Tom Hardy. I don't like smarties[?].

Space Jam 2, fucking Pawnstars. (00:48:19). . What do you feel. . [00:50:00]. Man, will it get real?. . (00:50:53). Squidward you had one job. Flipping them burger patties. Rollin' those damn fatties. I wonder what you think. If you try to blink. Man you can just imagine. That you were underground with an fat one. I mean under the ocean rollin' up. Tryin' to light a blunt in the ocean. I don't think that it would light, what emotion. Do you think if you think of Spongebob. Rollin' up under the ground in a pineapple. Under the sea, that is quite snapple [?] of me. To tell you exactly, you see?. I smell you, I feel you, E-40. Would say that to me if it was not so portly. If he was not better. Oh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40. And I was not on purpose. Lord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this. It just came out of my mouth then it felt the rudest.

Steering is the best, man, I'm clearin' out my chest. Now I gotta give you what I think. I don't think you should wear mink. But I think everybody should wear pink.

I woke up with a headache. But I still felt pretty relaxed. I knew in a couple hours. . [2:16:00] start. Because he was pouring sweat. A whole bunch of pictures. People thought he looked really bad. Looked really sweaty. They didn't elect him. Because he had. A real bad demeanor. And betweener. All of us. That's just politucs. What do we got next?. What's a history lesson in which the people can be blessed?. Looks like a big battleship. I'm not rattled if. That's what you think. I hope you don't blink. I don't know what this is all about. A hairdresser, man, I'm callin' out. And we're the confessor. All upon my dresser. I will not pester you. And I will not tester. There's some boobies in this pic. That's cool, free the nipple, man, that's real slick. Honestly, the male nipple and the female nipple. I don't really get the difference, man, is it that simple?. Why is one obscene?.

And I got this little funky soul patch. If I cut it off, will it grow back?. Yeah, probably, but not more. I think I got more on my cheeks. I've grown them for weeks but its uneven. I've got more on one side, it reeks. It sucks more on my left. It’s uneven hair, man, I’m distressed. But that’s okay. Our flaws is what makes us who we are. They’re what make me a superstar.

I don't know, it's not for me to decide. They don't let me cook at Thanksgiving. They don't want my gross vegetarian givings. Maybe someone will eat one serving. But nobody wants them, man. It's hurting my soul. One time I made soup. It was dope and swole. One time I made risotto, oh no. I quintoupled the fucking recipe. But no one wanted my cooking, it was the best of me. That's sad. Anyway, we'll go to sleep now. You know I cannot fucking sleep now. I be how I be always, understand. That in these hallways of my mind. My mind is so rubbery. My girlfriend said cover me. And you can discover me. Do you know about topiary. I am so necessary. I cut it like a fancy shrub. Fucking welcome to the club. Gotta give you a clue. You know what I can do.

That I got my voice, and I know that I got my choice. And it's stupendous. Tremendous flow, when I bend this dough. For the needs of my friends and the needs of y'all. I just get this all of my chest. My chest is throbbing like Batman and Robin. But I will not be robbing. I will not be lobbing softballs all over the plate. If I ever get to interview a politician - wait. I'm looking for a loophole. I'm just trying [?]. Get it, too swole. Scolded, scalded, man, you know. Gotta keep it simple. On a lake as I ripple. Feeling my nipple. Flowing to the tempo. Never let this end, no. I'm a real rice bloke. I will not choke. I don't do coke. Well, I did a couple times. I didn't like it. I thought I kinda had to try it. But it wasn't for me and I stopped. Two times - three times? Man, I dropped. Some acid, though, out in Venice. At the Biennale with my dentist. That was fucking cool, man. That was better than some school, man. I furrow my brow vexingly. No witches are hexxing me. I do it to the nth degree. I do it so specially. Cardiac is my speciality. You got no space balls. I could just make all. Of your dreams come true. Give you a harpoon. And a damn balloon. To pop I'm in the navigator. With an alligator. They say "See you later". They say "Meet me later at the pie spot". Grab some pie and some coffee. All these people get off me. It’s just me, Watsky. But you know that I'm not gonna be pulled. To your dimensions and ambitions. Did I mention that occasionally I get anxiety?. I have no real piety. I don’t know why it’s me in this body, but it is. So I try to be. An okay type of dude in my daily life. In my daily doings, and maybe I. Succeed from time to time and. Do good from rhyme to rhyme. But I am keenly aware that when you see me, you stare. 'Cause you're like "He looks like some dude who might make me cum. Just by looking." Oh, are you booking me with your eyes?. Are you cucking me? Why are you doing that?. You could rap about yourself in a strange day. Maybe you do every damn day. If so, you should send me the link. And when I’m not rapping for 33 hours straight. I think I’d try to watch you. If you sneeze, I would say “Achoo”. If you fucking fall, I gotchu. I try to get you up with my trust fall. I try to fucking say “Fuck all my doubts. All the dark thoughts”. I try to danish those harlots. I’m out at a used car lot. Singing some dope harmonics. SInging some harmonies. The devil can't be harming me. I got this great fantasy. That I'm on the faculty at my old school. But the school is in high rule. I’m not quite squeamish. I’m just on the scene, shit. Munching and munching. On this flow, I just jump in. All my hair is really bunchin’. And I’m eating my luncheon. Snap back on this velcro. They all say say "Hell no". I all say “Elmo:. But I know my elbow is really close. But you still can't bite it. That's a Russian proverb. You know I won't hide it. I won't hide it on my timeline. You know that I'm fine. I'm not dying on the vine. But I need to remind you. To rewind this like the time lapse. I might collapse. I might collate myself into notes. And then go late into that deep dark night. But not gently, man, I won't go. They meant me to go so fiercely. You know you can't pierce me. With your arrows and your slings. You know you can't bring me down. When you see this crown, I will not be drowned. Do it all for pocket change. Do it all and remain. I see some words from the chat. Thank you, man, I heard that. I think I'll get - woah, these are lots of words --. Maybe not, you know that you make me hot. Under the collar, holler for a dollar. Was that Honey Boo Boo? I don't know. You do the math. Who do you think you are?. I came so far. Words from the chat: cucumber. Up my butt, that makes me not slumber. Rip me in half, that would make me laugh. I am not better than John Cena. I no go bigger -- Cena, Mena. Pause, makes me pause, I can’t get ya. I am the supreme, dream team. You know that I mean on the scene. Play a small violin, hell no.

I won't ostracize anyone with weird eyes. Fucking Asian [?] orange, what rhymes with orange?. You know what rhymes with orange? George. Kind of, it's a slant rhyme. But I gotta dance, I'm happy. What’s hydrophobic? Afraid of water?. You know you go quick into dissing me. Are you saying that water on my lips has been missing me?. Sticking me in the back with these kind of sideways disses. I don't know, man. Water gets kisses from my lips. I'll fucking kiss this straw, and I get this raw. When I get this H2O, me and my duo - partner. Start your car, but you know I'm not a starter.

Up my damn coof. I don't know -- for a booboo hole. What could be that rhymes with coof. Stick in the opposite of my body’s roof. That was rude. Oh shit, man, damnnit. He just wove a damn vocal tapestry. Just clappin' the mic. And do it so laughably. You know I stay on ya. My words in layers like some lasagna. I'm no Flanagan. Irishman doing damn shenanigans. Actually, man, I'm like quarter Irish. On my mom's side, but I just get Eilish. Billie Eilish on the mic, really stylish. Man, I'm batting my eyelids. I play the etude, no attitude. And then I play the prelude. Out of order, I make my own rules. Got a camcorder, it's so cool. I play that mandala. But you know I swallow all of my pride. Popeye is all in my eye. In my grill, eating his goddamn spinach. Why you like that shit so much man, what is this?. I am hella bae. Hella bae'd out, as clear as cellophane. What the hell remains after that shit out on Anza [?]. Aguirre, a whole damn bonanza. Hear me, I live out on Cabrillo [?]. I scrub like a brillo pad. It's the texture of my hair. And my next flow is recipe. Y'all really got the best of me. All the quality ingredients. You know that you see me slip. I’m like a bonsai tree. I grow so slow. That I’m on my back, I barely move. When I flow, I am like a kind of lizard. Maybe, I don’t know, which kind -. A baby fucking kimodo?. Do they go slow or do they go real fast?. Ask someone else, I don’t know, I fucking pass. I’m so fucking pure. All my references are so fucking obscure. They're like, "Damn, you suck more than a fucking vacuum". That's not true, I fucking thank you. For reminding me that time is now. To do what I do, I'm quite down. You, though, are out there like Pluto. I don't take caloric readings into account. But I am just prehistoric, on some mesozoic era shit. I am very Land Before Time, man, it’s very quipped. Well equipped, like Littlefoot or Petrie. Man I will not razzle you, I'm not dazzled. I don't embezzle funds from these funds, I won't take a dollar. Not a red cent, I won't holler. Man, fuck this breeze comin' through on my knees. I'm Chuck E. Cheese. I got this piranha flow, I got the jump off. man. So Geronimo!. Man, I'm on the way down. But they can't take my crown. With these verbal ballistics, I need these statistics. The elephant in the squad. Is not relevant, man, that's odd. I just rhyme frequently. And I do it with indecency. But I got respect from all where my peers intersect. But I connect with yo on my goddamn Rolodex. Not in my Rolls Royce. I have just got no choice. I'm a cuck. That's not true, try my luck. That's the first thing that I said when the cuck card popped up. I don't watch my girlfriend fuck others. That would be kind of strange for our relationship, ayeee. Don't wanna play that way. It's okay if you do, but that not my thang thang. I brang brang rhymes and I try to sang sang. Get some more protein, you know that I mean. What I seen, I am not a dinkle leaf [?]. Little type of periwinkle. That was a very poorly constructed rhyme. But you know, fuck, I can find sometimes. I'm behind my mind in my mouth ways. You know I go gray [?]. I just get all in, I am just fallin'. Sometimes I say "Fuck it,". I got a little whack nugget of rhymes. And then I put it to the side. And then I just rewind my mind. And get these rhymes so hectic. When the morning becomes eclectic. Shout out to KCRW. Support your local stations, it won't trouble you. Getting so mega. Buying a ham, bacon, cheese at a bodega. I just gotta say I don't know how to play. The next word in the pile. It really makes me spile. But repugnant is not an easy word to rhyme. So I put it at the top of the rhyme and I'm fine. And I'll need some caffeine in a couple hours. When I'm on the damn scene, but for now. I'm fucking good as hell. Unscrewing my mind, man, you can tell. That is coming off like a relief cap that I just had to doff. I hope you don't scoff if I just seem soft. I feel animated, I feel that I made it -- oh shit!. What we got now? Kush Mody, throwing it down. Can I get just a bit more volume?. I am just callin' em. It feels good to fucking flow the Mody beat. Maybe a little more even? Just a fucking smiggen. I am not a stool pigeon -- that's awesome. Shout out to the DJ, replay. Everything you said, man, I'll relay. All inside of my head. Minding my own business until I am fucking dead. Man, remember Kush Mody, out in Boston. We got lost in the sauce and we did it. Man, we knew each other so long. I can’t even believe that we been so strong. And with Jackson out in the winter. We were like Master Splinter. You remember, we were doing it. We were making that music shit. I'm so proud and glad at how far we've come. And how far we had to run. I'm flipping like an acrobat on the beat. Can you fucking handle that? I will repeat this. It's about connectivity. This is nativity. It's like the young Christ giving me strength. I don't think twice, I just go back. I'm a player, but I don't crush a lot. I just wanna hit the beat a lot. I fucking got to repeat you, I'm useful. But you know that I am full. . I'm not just reactive. I'm radioactive. But I am that kid. And I take it back quick. . The next word is adultery. Fucking plucked like upholstery [?]. . The beat keeps on thumpin'. Kush mody on the beat keep on bumpin'. The hour gettin' ungodly. Will I keep on going. Probably. I don't wanna create a fiasco. Just because of my wack flow. I wanna keep on goin'. I wanna keep on rowin'. 11:02:50. Shoutout to Kudy Hodge. He does his duty. He’s a god. On the mic. Like supposedly. You know that yo it’s me. I got it in the pocket. I gotta fuckin’ lock it. Down.

Because our lives are so bountiful. And we gotta just power through. Live and thank ourselves and our lucky stars. Or wonder where the fuck we are. In the universe. This is so true it hurts. But I'm not a salesman. I'm more a drink and an ale man. Bringing the truth like a mailman. Feeling like a maniac. Flowing like a brainiac. Because you know that the way I rap. Is so goddamn loquacious. That I'm saying it's gracious. . When I'm on the mic I say shit. But otherwise I might not like to say. But I can’t just put this damn mic away. . I'm in my cubby hole.

Who are you. . All of these night critters. Are giving me real jitters. In the morning I won't eat fritters. . I'll probably eat more smoothie. I wonder how much more there is. A lot. It doesn't have much fizz. Although at some point I have to drink the redbull-y. And then you will have to pull me. Up. On my ass from the couch. And I don't know if I doubt. Myself.
