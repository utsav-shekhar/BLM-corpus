There's a man in the back, that I want you to check. On the right turntable, the left he exact. With the mixer in the center to conduct the scratch. Every cut that he creates, is right and exact. Yo Eddie F. keep 'em busy, 'til I get back. Here we go. . [Eddie F. Scratches]. . [Verse 4]. I got my rest I feel fresh now it's time to hustle. Fellas grab your 40's, and go guzzle. But quickly return you might miss the end. You'll be mad if you hear about it from a friend. By the look on your face, I tell that you are pleased. By the look on my face, you tell I did it with ease. Grab your Kodak, before I break take a picture. And as you leave I hear you whisper, "We'll miss ya". But don't fret, I'll be back you can bet. But now I really must go, cause I'm drippin' with sweat. But do me a favor before I leave the show. Throw your hands in the air, let me hear y'all say. Here we. [Chorus]. . [Outro: Heavy D].
