This for the nappy heads in heaven. With a nappy head Christ by they side. . [Post-Chorus]. Yeah, may your streets be paved with gold. Yeah, hope my whole hood make it home. Yeah, may your streets be paved with gold. Yeah, hope my whole hood make it home. Yeah. [Verse 1]. 'Cause the world can be toxic. Especially when your skin looked like chocolate. At one point they sold us for profit. But we made it out of the gauntlet, we chosen. Yeah, on my mama, the south side still holding. Yeah, go for broke for the ones that are broken. Yeah, please don't make me no hashtag or slogan. My whole hood is golden. . [Chorus]. That's why I pray you catch a wave. That doesn't subside. This for the nappy heads in heaven.

Yeah, may your streets be paved with gold (Paved with gold). Yeah, hope my whole hood make it home (Make it home). Yeah, may your streets be paved with gold (Paved with gold).
