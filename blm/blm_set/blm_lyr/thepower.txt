Say what you want to say. That is not my concern. I will neva lose my way. Forward mi go, an' I have no time to reverse. . [Chorus: Warrior King]. Dem can't get me down. Could neva get me down. Hypocrites and vipers around. Dey try to push me to the ground, Jah. Dem can't get me down. Could neva get me down. I praise the one who wears a crown. The one who sits on David's throne. [Verse 1: Warrior King]. Today for you tomorrow for me. That’s how it goes. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. You betta know. Live is a cycle naturally that’s how it flows. I am a overcomer so I can't be overthrown now. Everyday I give Jah thanks and praise. For he’s the one who give me latter day. When I’m timid, he makes me brave. To fight against those who try to put me in a grave. . [Chorus: Warrior King]. Dem can't get me down. Could neva get me down. Hypocrites and vipers around. Dey try to push me to the ground, Jah. Dem can't get me down. Could neva get me down. I praise the one who wears a crown. The one who sits on David's throne. . [Verse 2: Warrior King]. Dem a penny me. Can't study me. For nuh reason at all they criticize me. Dem can't trouble me, neither worry me. I’m protected by the power of the trinity. I’m like the seed that be in fertile soil. I bear good fruits and yuh know dem can't spoil. Pot it a bubble and food it a boil. I’m a survivor. I'll tell you all the while. You might also like[Chorus: Warrior King]. Dem can't get me down.
