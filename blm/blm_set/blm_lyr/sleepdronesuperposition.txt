I ain’t waiting for nothing. I just show up to shine. That or don't show at all. Sit at home and unwind. They continue they fronting. They keep ignoring the signs. Ain't shit out there I'm hunting. Everything in its time. An it's right now. That bright black. With a sharp tongue. And the beats crack. And he bites back. With shark teeth. And he eats that. That black blocker. That can't stop when the coppers creep. And I don't show up I'm trash talk. I'm fuck peace. I'm Chris Dorner I'm Doberman dirty off leash. I'm Mike Brown I'm Eric Garner I can't breathe. We face down. Our teeth are touching the concrete. They curb stomping us. Wearing a crown in our streets. It makes the. Bullshit trivial. Gave a lot of trust and some years to. Some miserable-. Castles made of sand. Heavy hand holding shovels. And trouble man. Counts his real friends on his hook stomp. Shit, I used to spend a lotta thought on loss. I used to need for every feeling amplified too. You prol'ly learned early it's better to be hated. And I hate whoever taught you that. I'm happy to have learned from you. Huh, same page different book (weird). Hard feelings. Soft hearts overlooked. But not here. That whole veneer 20/20 clear. Keep my warnings out your people's ear try to let em steer. For themselves. Water and bridges. Hurricanes and tryna rebuild visions. Pick a pain I'm sure that I got limits. But fuck it, I'll make incisions. Till I'm dead and re-risen as energy. [Bridge]. Tryna exist in superposition. Tryna exist in superposition. Tryna exist in superposition. Clock tickin. Keep livin. Man listen. Come on. . [Chorus: All]. Show up to shine. Show me a sign. Show up to shine. Show me a sign. Show up to shine. Show me a sign. Show up to shine. Show me a sign. . [Verse: P.O.S]. I tried to write a note to everyone who came out and supported when my kidney couldn't clean up my poisonous blood. But I just stared at the page. And when I wrote it I felt nothing but the numbing of cliche and tasted nothing but batteries and iron all over my tongue. Words rusted in place. And all I want is to chisel my initials into something permanent now. And raise up these damn kids and make my momma so fucking proud. And mutilate a couple crowds. (Dead). And all I want is to make art. Keep takes. Break what they say it is. Fakes run the game. And your boy ain't playing it. Nah, there ain’t no sense in this haze. Uh, if it's up to me. I'll keep the questions in my frequency and throw em often. From now until the coffin calls 'em. And I spit where ever cops be walking. You might also like[Kathleen Hanna]. You’re supposed to be happy to be alive. You’re supposed to be lucky to be alive. You’re supposed to be. . If it's up to me. The only people in the streets with guns lead communities or hunt for food they need to fight through. Maybe peacefully. Shit, but that's a big maybe. There's more than one way to skin Schrödinger's cat. Not sure what's holding you back. There's nothing seriously stopping us. Getting blown off the map. Yeah, tryna exist in-. . [Hard_R]. Predict coming events. Visions make me dense. So fuck your two cents. Still a shoulder rub gent. Colder with resent. Fold for what it’s meant. It’s over, my man. Go eat a Xan'. . [Allan Kingdom]. You gotta prove your position. You got a new superstition. I could'a never sold dope and hustled through your position. Gimme all black weddings and an all white funeral. Ball like pendulums and I write numerals. Numbers on the boards of life and all mics shootable. Even on your frozen nights when all thighs useable. (future addiction). [Hard_R]. I’m not an MC. What’s up, candy rappers. White talkin' keys no houses but with backwards. All these new OGs they got us moving backwards. Whole race at our knees. History in the crapper. . [Astronautalis]. I want the food to taste like poison. Till the poison tastes like food. I want your home to feel like prison. Till you up and hit the road. I want your job to feel like torture. Till you burn the building down. I want to raise a fucking family out the ashes of this town. . [P.O.S]. I miss a quark. And my dark parts wish I didn't. She called me buster and gutted me at the finish. And then it ended-. Only clean break ever and I love her more now prolly cause of that. In the black. I miss a writer. Who never quite took my edits. I built a pedestal taller than she could let it. And I love her more now cause of that. Infinite slack. I tied my own rope she took it back. Instead. In the red -. Balancing books and. Pre-cum promises. When love is mean enough to go where it's not wanted and. Fuck up a good simple an sweet. Bliss. Repeat. Campsite rules. Hope it's better when you leave. Shit, I miss myself without these calluses. Only hate two and call 'em dad so the irony can cut through. I won't be at either funeral. I don't need to see I disrespect them gleefully and eat the pain, rage and guilt. I keep it deep in me. Release my fist. When my ashes hit the pacific and I'm infinitely swimming in the ether. Where the teachers be-. Waves. Thumbs up. Sunglasses emoji. Peace. . [Bridge]. Tryna exist in superposition. Tryna exist in superposition. Tryna exist in superposition. Clocks ticking. Keep living. Man listen. Come on. . [Chorus: All and Kathleen Hanna]. Am I trapped inside my body like it's a burning building. Show up to shine. Show me a sign. Or am I the match that lit myself on fire. Show up to shine. Show me a sign. . [P.O.S]. (Like a snowflake in an avalanche). I been waiting for nothing. This pain is nothing. I be clutching my stomach. But this, this here is nothing. Scheming on what I wanted. This pain is nothing. This pain is pumping through my veins, it's nothing. Nothing is what I'll take. Everything in its time. Yeah, nothing is what I'll ask for. Everything I will make. Ready the fucking drums. Get ready to feel it shake. It's better than being numb. And better owning mistakes. Jehu. Yank crime on ten. Scream super unison. Superposition livin' a. Dream like a hooligan. Live like. Dreams might be. Like a real life. See them react. Try to, act how it feels right. Then go. . [Bridge]. Tryna exist in superposition (Go).
