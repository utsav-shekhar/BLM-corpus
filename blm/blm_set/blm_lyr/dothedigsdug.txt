A hero ain't nuttin' but a sandwich. I mean, well I need a hoagie if I am to manage. To fill myself up and stay fat. Yo yo, I gotta kick the raps, yo yo I gotta keep the naps. Well, see, its like this um, I forgot to mention. You was slingin' on my wingding. Swingin' like the Wringling. Suckers on the trapeze. Back and forth please. I keeps ya on ya toes to keeps ya off ya knees. Oops, I'm sorry, I'm just a Goat-man ach. First ya did some flips, but now ya just flopped. Damn, ouch, I didn't mean ta be that blunt. I gave ya what cha got cause I gives ya what ya want. [OaTie]. Bustin' down the door, bustin' down the door. Found the corporate heads dippin' Bush like a whore. Sayin' what is it for, what is it for?. The green, the green, please back me some more. Leonard Peltier, Leonard Peltier. Who da hell is that, why the fuck should I care?. In jail, in jail, in jail like a dealer. "Fuck George Bush!" says my T-Shirt squealer!. Please, oh please set Leonard P. free;. Cause ya wiped out his race like an ant colony. Whatcha afraid of?. Annie Mae Aquash?. Found her lying in the ditch with no place for a watch. . Chorus:. ¿Do the Dugs Dig?. ¿Do the Digs Dug?. . [Swayzack]. I don't dig apple pie. It's an American lie. Because I dug between the lines. All I found was swine. Direct control. I won't fold or succumb. I mean, be overcome. I mean, you know what I mean. The green team. Ain't down with the White House clowns. Pushing round mounds of shit. Tryin' to pound it down our throats. But dig it. I'd rather have a bud than a scud. Dug it. Cause I'ma pour tha salt on the slugs. Unplug it. The T.V.,. Cause I don't need to see. Dan Rather. Cause it doesn't matter to me. They lather me up. But their suds are weak. But I'ma burn some Bushes. And cut the Quayle's beak. You might also like[Madd]. Uh oh, yo, here I come again. Holdin' up the crap. Like a diaper, Depends. Aw George. Ya don't pay attention. Put down the golf clubs. And stop takin' away the pensions. What cha ma call it?. The Emancipation Procla…somethin'?. It doesn't mean a thing. Cause back then I wasn't nothin'. Just 1/3 of. What's that word, um. Human. Fuck that, "Four score!". Furthermore I'm fumin'!. What's their face?. Ah Powell, I know ya dig it. A general, an officer, a pig to a piglet. They're both givin' time. They're both gettin' mine. It's time for Goats ta roast swine. . [Chorus]. [OaTie]. Let me check my Glock cause it's time to be checkin' it. In this age of no phase. Ya know who's gonna be wreckin' it. With a crazy, spacy. Hendrix like hazy. Purple maple syruple. Jump the hurdle never lazy. Flim flam of Uncle Scam. Makes ya guard ya wad. Got heads of the state. Deciding fates like God. Makin' racists out of toddlers. Soldiers outta bums. Put that wad in front of congress. See who cums first; cause they're cuttin' funds like liverwurst. Curse bout the purse and they'll drop ya in the hearse. With niggers shooting blacks. Yep. Feds supply the gats. Dropping 8 ball jackets like Minnesota Fats. . [Swayzack]. Congratulations on your biggest stunt yet. But you can't hit my blunt if your lips are wet, baby!. Call me crazy and I'm not the pretentious type. Just looks like maybe you's on the pipe. So go take another pull off the glass dick. The way you drool, I think your lips was elastic. I asked Madd, he said you got your ass kicked. Try'n to play your pops for his plastic. Swayzack's cuttin' tracks on the head cracks. Gonna slay some monkeys for the junkies. Stay back and put the caps on the hat rack. Cause here's the plan: the man's gonna get funky. . Chorus. Do The Dugs Dig, Do The Dugs, Dig. Diggy Diggy Dug, Do The. Dugs Dig, DugEmbed
