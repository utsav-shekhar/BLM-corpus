"stand up, make it right or get the hell out of my way!". I´m so sick in tired of your hopes, your dreams, your plans. You know they´ll never happen with the thumb up in your ass. . When the heat is right. I´ll make it count. No one will. Get me down. I´ll show everyone. You will see. I won't go undone. I shuold give up the smoking and I should join the gym. For beach 2050 I´ll look sexy, young and slim. I´ll learn healthy cooking, it´s gonna be my thing. But first I´ll have a pizza with extra everything. . I would like to think of my self as something more. More than empty words of revolution, hate and war. I so wanted to belive but I know it´s just a dream. I am just like you no matter what I try to see. . When the heat is right. I´ll make it count. No one will. Get me down. I´ll show everyone. You will see. I won't go undone. . Who am I fooling no one will by this crap. When I´m about 100 I´ll still sit in someones lap. You better live this day like it´s gonna be your last. While I spent my whole life like it´s got no fucking past. . When the heat is right. I´ll make it count. No one will. Get me down. I´ll show everyone. You will see. I won't go undoneYou might also likeEmbed
