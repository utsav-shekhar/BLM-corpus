Seeds of bitter root will grow bitter fruit. A tree without its limbs, where's the righteousness?. It's better to be lowly along with the oppressed. Whatever's in our hearts, our lives will reflect. . [Pre-Chorus]. Help us to be planted in You, Lord. . [Chorus]. Let love lead. No matter how long the road. Let love lead. Even when it's not comfortable, comfortable. Let love lead. 'Cause we got nothing if we don't have love. Let love lead. Let love lead, let love lead us, yeah. Oh-oh-oh. Let love lead us, yeah. Oh-oh-oh. Let love lead us. [Verse 2]. He wasn't born a thug, a mother's only son. No father that he knew, where does he turn to?. Something will fill that space, the streets will indoctrinate. The love of God he craves, we can't turn him away. . [Chorus]. Let love lead. No matter how long the road. Let love lead. Even when it's not comfortable, comfortable. Let love lead. 'Cause we got nothing if we don't have love. Let love lead. Let love lead, let love lead us, yeah. Oh-oh-oh. Let love lead us, yeah, yeah. Oh-oh-oh. Let love lead us, yeah. Oh-oh-oh. . [Bridge].
