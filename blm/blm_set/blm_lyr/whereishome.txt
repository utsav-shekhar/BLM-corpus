After the funeral breaking kola nuts. We sit and reminisce about the past. And in her voice only sadness. Her only son taken from her. . [Chorus]. In every headline we are reminded. That this is not home for us. In every headline we are reminded. That this is not home for us. [Verse 1]. The second generation blues. Our point of view not listened to. Different worlds and different rules. A question of allegiance. Clinging to her Bible and her scapular. And the memory of the way things were. I don't see hope, I cannot smile. I burn with anger all the time. . [Pre-Chorus]. We all read, what they did. To the black boy. . [Chorus]. In every headline we are reminded. That this is not home for us. . [Post-Chorus]. Where is it?. Where is home?. Where is it?. Where is home?. . [Verse 2]. I walk this modern tight-rope. Of humility and belligerence. This tommy-rot and flag waving. Is getting me down. You might also like[Bridge]. I want to stamp on the face of every young policeman. To break the fingers of every old judge. To cut off the feet of every ballerina. But I cannot. . So I just sigh, and I just sulk. And I pretend that there's nothing wrong. The teeth of this world tear me in half. And everyday I must ask myself where?. . [Post-Chorus]. Where is it?. Where is home?. Where is it?. Where is home?. . [Chorus]. In every headline we are reminded. That this is not home for us. In every headline we are reminded. That this is not home for usEmbed
