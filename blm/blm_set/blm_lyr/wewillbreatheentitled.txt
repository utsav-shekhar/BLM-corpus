Hmm. Funny you could feel entitled. To take away a life. But I can’t feel entitled to stand up for my rights. Sad that you could feel entitled. To kill him with your knee. But he can’t feel entitled. To just live his life and breathe. Funny you could feel entitled. With power in your skin (Power in your skin). But I can’t feel entitled. With the skin that I am in (Skin that I am in). It’s funny you could feel entitled. With a system that benefits you. But anytime we want some justice seems to be an issue. Funny you can cause disruption. And gather all for nothin’. But we can’t even march for change or gather for discussion. About life and what is right. For change and what is wrong. Like “I Can’t Breathe”. Or walk down the street. “Don’t shoot”, It’s just a phone. [Chorus: Ain't Afraid]. We will breathe. By any means, do you feel me?. We will breathe. I had a dream, do you hear me?. We will breathe. By any means necessary. We will breathe. Lift every voice and sing. We will breathe. By any means, do you feel me?. We will breathe. I had a dream, do you hear me?. We will breathe. By any means necessary. We will breathe. Lift every voice and sing. . [Verse 2: Ain't Afraid]. We're demanding justice. For all of the injustice. Protect & serve, enforce the law but you think you're above it. It's heartbreaking to see. We all fit the description. Living in a world ran by systemic racism. But we shall overcome. My people are resilient. We're not asking you. We're telling you to stop the killings. You might also like[Chorus: Ain't Afraid}. We will breathe (We will breathe). By any means, do you feel me?.
