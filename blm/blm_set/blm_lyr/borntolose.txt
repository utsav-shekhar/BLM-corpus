Born to cry when I hear you're near. Born to smile through a mist of tears. Born to live, lost in lonely years. Born to lose every game I play. You must go, there's no other way. Touch my life with your love once more. It must last till forever more. Take my love, take my life, my soul. Take my dreams, take my word, my own. Would I change? Could I only choose?. No, not me, I was born to lose. Take my love, take my life, my soul. Take my dreams, take my word, my own. Would I change? Could I only choose?. No, not me, I was born to lose. Take my love, take my life, my soul. Take my dreams, take my word, my own. Would I change? Could I only choose?. No, not me, I was born to lose. Take my love, take my life, my soul. Take my dreams, take my word, my ownYou might also likeEmbed
