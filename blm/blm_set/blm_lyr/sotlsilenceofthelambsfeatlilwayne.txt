Here we go, Luda!. . [Verse 1: Ludacris]. The world's screwed and niggas pourin’ drinks like Bill Huxtable (Ha). I love R. Kelly but around my daughters, I'm not comfortable (Uh). Stand for what you believe in like Kaepernick. You either in control or you gettin' fucked, no abstinence. Huh, it’s not enough blacks in the drivin' seat like a Nascar. Why? Cause most racist people still drinkin' what's at Roseanne's bar. Hah, Gandhi told me to be the change that I wanna see. But Mayweather told me blow my change on the shopping spree. What the world needs now (What's that?). Is love sweet love (Is love sweet love). But while the world takes its time. Can I get some drug sweet drugs? (Drug sweet drugs). 'Cause when you rich too rich, all you get is mug, mean mugs. And I'm gettin’ to that age, sweet age. I shouldn’t be up in the club, sweet club. Damn, grown shit, oldest daughter 'bout to go to college, nigga. Least I can do is leave her with a little knowledge, nigga. Yeah the clock’s tickin' but just know that all my music timeless, nigga. Ha, rap brought me back to restore a little bit of balance, nigga. [Chorus: Lil Wayne]. Uh, goin' brazy in the Lamb. I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the ’Gram. Uh, pay these niggas no mind. Tried to pay attention, gotta underpay 'em. Damn, shit 'bout to get ugly. Like Shabba Ranks, Mr. Lover Man. Damn, anytime the GOAT speak. All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch. Any questions, any problems. We could talk about it or we could shoot shots, swish. If the message in the bottle too hard to swallow. We could do shots, bitch. Goin' brazy in the Lamb. I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram. Uh, anytime the GOAT speak. All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch. . [Verse 2: Ludacris]. Yeah, life's a test that X's all the losers from winners (Yeah). Oh, watch me pass on that ass like Kendall Jenner (Woah). Woah, they say between love and hate there's a thin line (Yeah). I say love or hate, still no snitchin', that's a 6ix9ine (No). .45 tucked away in the gut (Uh) ain't a killer but don't test me. 'Cause if any nigga try to come at me or my family. Then the cops is gonna have to arrest me, catch me, fetch me. Niggas is wearin' a bulletproof vest just to go outside (Brr). Innocent people are bystanders. Some are recordin' murders on they cameras or they on Live (Live). Social media got kids wantin' to commit suicide (Damn). 'Cause everybody's gettin' scrutinized (Damn). 'Gram stuntin', those the truest lies. Now the parents need to be supervised. That's ass backwards. Bombs blowin' from the terrorist attackers (Woah). Natural disasters, computer crashes (Woah). World leaders clashin' (Ooh). Separatin' us into different classes. Protect the elite and destroy the masses. So all up in the hood, it's pistols blastin'. No wonder why the hood gets not compassion. We don't have no shape, form or fashion. Feelin' like Mother Earth is mismatchin'. So we gotta hurry up and take some action. Or close your eyes and just imagine, damn.
