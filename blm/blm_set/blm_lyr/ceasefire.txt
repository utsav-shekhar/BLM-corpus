Inglorious soldier I stand 'till the end. A golden revolver I hold in my hand. The trigger that I never squeeze. The war that brings me to my knees. I'm tired of fighting for peace. When I am alone on the front line. I need you to stand next to me. . [Chorus]. Baby, cease fire, fire, fire. Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons. I'm on your side, on your side, on your side. So please cease fire, fire, fire. Cease fire, make it stop. [Verse 2]. Drop down your defenses, I'm raising my flag. This fighting is hopeless, we need this to end. It's going too far, don't know where it began. We're hurting each other and I can't pretend. I'm trying to help you to see. The casualties that we both leave. It's all so unnecessary. Can't you hear me scream?. . [Chorus]. Baby, cease fire, fire, fire. Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons. I'm on your side, on your side, on your side. So please cease fire, fire, fire. Cease fire, make it stop. . [Bridge]. Rolling out. White flag, I surrender. Hear me now, make it stop, we can do better. Pain and hurt, living in fear, wasted energy. In the end, what is it worth? What is our legacy?. Rolling out. White flag, I surrender. Hear me now, make it stop, we can do better. Pain and hurt, living in fear, wasted energy. In the end, what is it worth? What is our legacy?. Follow me now, I'm calling out. Somebody help me, I need you now. Why can't you see? Gotta believe me. Fighting for peace, need a release. Won't you come with me?. I'm on your side, swallow your pride. You can confide in me, army of one. Rise of the sun, shining for all to see. Enemy's none, victory's won, no negativity. We can be free, we have the key to own our destiny.

So please cease fire, fire, fire. Cease fire, make it stopEmbed
