When i can say, that nothing can hold me down. I will fight through all the pain. It's a journey i will make. You can try. But you will never break this heart. Of mine again. [Chorus]. Sometimes it feels like freedom is far away. But i know, yes i know. I will break all the chains, yeah. Sometimes it feels like nothing will ever change. But i know, yes i know. I will break all the chains, yeah. . [Verse 2]. You wanna tear me apart. But i am strong, i am strong. No matter how hard you try. I'll never let you see my tears. I've found the place where i belong, i belong. . [Pre-Chorus]. I'll rise beyond and soar above my fears. I will fight through all the pain. It's a journey i will make. You can try. But you will never break this heart. Of mine again. . [Chorus]. Sometimes it feels like freedom is far away. But i know, yes i know. I will break all the chains, yeah. Sometimes it feels like nothing will ever change. But i know, yes i know. I will break all the chains, yeah. You might also like[Bridge]. (I know). I'ts not easy i know. Just gotta let it go.
