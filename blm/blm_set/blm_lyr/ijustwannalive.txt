I just wanna live. God protect me. . [Verse 1]. I'm a young black man. Doing all that I can. To stand. Oh, but when I look around. And I see what's being done. To my kind. Every day. I'm being hunted as prey. My people don't want no trouble. We've had enough struggle. [Chorus]. I just wanna live. God protect me. (Just stay right by my side). I just wanna live. God protect me. (Just stay right by my side). . [Verse 2]. So many thoughts in my head. Will I live or will I end up dead?. It's an unequal sequel. No matter where I be. There's no place safe for me. Oh, oh. I'm not asking for too much. So Lord, please, help. . [Chorus]. I just wanna live. God protect me. (Just stay right by my side). I just wanna live. God protect me. (Just stay right by my side).
