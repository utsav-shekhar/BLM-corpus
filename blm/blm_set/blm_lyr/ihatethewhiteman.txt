In the land of look-and-see. There once was a time. For you and me. . Where the winds blow sweetly. And the easy seas flow still. And where the barefoot dream of life. Can laugh and cry its fill. . Where slot machine confusion. And the plastic universe. Are objects of amusement. In the fiction of their curse. And where the crazy whiteman. And his teargas happiness. Lies dead and long since buried. By his own fantastic mess. . For I hate the whiteman. And his plastic excuse. For I hate the whiteman. And the man who turned him loose.... . And the reins of coloured thunder. Of the stallion of the dawn. Ride the coalfire morning. On the beach where all is born. . Where the emperor of meaning. Is burning up his fort. And sits to warm his toes around. A fire made up of useless thoughts. . And when the children tempt him. With the riddles of their trance. He flings the flames of solstice. Casting laughs into their dance. . And where the crazy whiteman. In the desert of his bones. Lies as bleached as the paradise. He likes to think he owns. You might also likeAnd I hate the whiteman. In his ever-green excuse. Oh I hate the whiteman. And the man who turned him loose.... . And far across the reaches. Of the drifting yellow sands. The living carpet wilderness. Forever joins its hands. . With heaven's hell's attainment. In a surging crest of fire. Where more than all is thrown upon. The ever lasting pyre. . And through the countless canticles. Of Jason's charcoal fleece. Are sung the songs of nothing. In the timeless masterpiece. . And there stood in the middle. Guess who?. It's the everlasting burst. Built by god's very own whiteman. As he tries to rule the dust. And I hate the whiteman. In his doctrinaire refuse. Oh I hate the whiteman. And the man who turned you all loose.... . And the bowels of his city. Have been locked into a safe. Where the spew stains on the sidewalks. Are defenders of his faith. . While back inside his kitchen. The bowler-hatted, long-haired saint. Cleans with soap and water. But it's really just white paint. . While his Gorgon-headed scandal sheet. Presents its daily bite. To give their righteous news-believers. Drugs to keep them white. . While outside in the whitewash. Where the guns are always, always right. A shooting star has summoned. Death's dark angel from his night. . And I hate the whiteman. And his ever-green excuse. Oh I hate the whiteman. And the man who turned you all loose. And the man who turned him loose...Embed
