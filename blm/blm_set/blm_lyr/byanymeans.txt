(Oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh). So go ahead and fix your crown. Then watch it all burn in smoke, oh, oh. Go ahead and stand your ground. We're on the long road to freedom, oh, no. . [Verse 1]. Too much time tryna figure out why. Too much time to be patient. All this time you be feeding us lies. Ain't no truth in your statements. Too much pain in these little white lies. You left here. All this time tryna figure out how. We still here. I take pride in the things that we've done. Side by side in the revolution. Won't stay silent for things that I love. 'Cause we know dem nuh care about us. White men can't jump but at least they can run. Broke these chains just to put our hands up. They can never see the kingdom coming. You wanna see us all amount to nothing, no. [Pre-Chorus]. I can see your face, see the light in your eyes. I can see the change, feel the heat of the fire. If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive. Both feet on the line. . [Chorus]. By any means, I will fight (For you, for you), oh, no. By any means, I will fight (For you, for you). By any means, I will fight (For you, for you). By any means, I will fight (For you, for you). . [Post-Chorus]. I've spent too many days in my head now. Did you think we would forget, how?. Too many destinies, too many sentences. Read now, read now. See all this pain in the headlines. But I have cried for the last time. But know what happens, see. You would be blind if it was just an eye for an eye. . [Verse 2]. And what if we changed the world?. We rise from the flames the victor. It's far from a perfect picture. I know we're sinful but we are human. Would you be grateful if you took my place?. Say my name (Say my name). There is redemption in the steps we take. Say, one life and I'm gonna use it (Oh). Innocent 'til I am proven (Oh, no). One last chance and you blew it (Oh). One last dance in the ruins (Oh). So much hate in your movements (Oh, no). Told me I couldn't prove it (No). One last prayer for the sinners (Ooh). You only learn what you witness (Ooh, ooh-ooh). You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. I can see your face, see the light in your eyes. I can see the change, feel the heat of the fire. If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive. Both feet on the line. . [Chorus]. By any means, I will fight (For you, for you), oh, no. By any means, I will fight (For you, for you). By any means, I will fight (For you, for you). By any means, I will fight (For you, for you). . [Post-Chorus]. I've spent too many days in my head now. Did you think we would forget, how?. Too many destinies, too many sentences. Read now, read now. See all this pain in the headlines. But I have cried for the last time. But know what happens, see.
