You are listening to Poon Patrol Radio. . Poon Patrol Radio. Is it good? I don't know. Get 'em high, get 'em low. I don't know, I don't know. Poon Patrol Radio. Poon Patrol Radio. I don't know. Have you heard the story of Icarus?. The sun killed him 'cause he got too high. Poon Patrol is pretty similar. Except we will never die. . GET READY TO BUST OPEN THAT PUSSY!!. . (God, fuck, fuck, fucked up this fucking song again, fuck!). This one's for all the lonely dads out there. You know who you are. . [The Verse, 2:00-8:42]. Name's Hank Hill, propaner insaner. Out the brainer, been known to snort the cocainer. And my dick's as long as a couple of toothpicks. And my asshole can only fit two dicks. Maybe three, if I eat some casserole. We could cram another into my fat asshole. I'm startin' to get burly, I'm a little bit lost. How much did the holla cost?. About six million, and I got a billion. 'Cause I can do whatever I set my mind to. Except blow shit up with it, only when I'm not trying to. And all I want in life is a collection of lawn chairs. And some gummy bears. Throw in some gay sex like American History X. Like I'm Ed Norton, Pusha to the T. When I'm [?] some earthquake. Or maybe even a vanilla milkshake. Let's hear some Seinfeld bass and eat some toothpaste. Nothing about me is kind. Like trying to high-five the blind. Like if I was Mister Seacrest. Selling one-hundred-twenty-dollar hip-hop shirts. Like I was Kanye West. Like I'm always losing, like a-ha, honey. And there's nothing funny about the Easter Bunny. In the middle of July. Pinocchio knows and I just can't lie. You might also likeMaybe it's just my heritage. I want to grow up to be as fake as Lamar Odom's marriage is. While I stare at his sister-in-laws' carriages. While I spout out some ray-jays and shoot some AKs. 'Cause it's the return of the P-double-O-N. We're as Bad as the Sin, that's a joke about the comedian. Somebody please stop feeding him. Why's it always sunny in Philly? Please fill me in, Charlie Day. But who knew Mac was gay?. But I'm all about pride, and I love kittens. So let's give him some little kitten mittens. While I'm spittin' like Walt Whitman. Like I'm on the toilet but I will not spoil it. Just watch season five. Shoot some heroin and listen to Dive. And the sky sure is blue. And if you asked me my favorite day of the week. I'd have to choose two. The two where I eat cheese pizza and chill with my crew. Always on the patrol for poon, play that pussy like a bassoon. . And I'll eat your whole asshole, you'll go "holy mackerel". When I come out lookin' like a raccoon. Except the mask is just your shit. And I'll apologize to your armpit. For foreseeing me sneezing in it, just spray some Febreze in it. And when I say I'm sorry know I meant it. And know that your gooch was splendid. That's the path between your cooch and your butt crack. And I know my compliments are wack. And I know my pick-up lines are wack. But you know you like the One Man Wolf Pack. That's what I call my ball sack. 'Cause I've only got one teste. And if he was gay he'd slap his two besties. What happened when the cow's dad touched him?. He got moo-lested, just like your patience is getting tested. This song isn't even about pizza with cheese. He's just rapping about the birds and the bees. Ladies, be quiet, let me see your knees. And I'll blow you some kisses. And I won't stop until R. Kelly pisses me off. Like when old ladies say no, guess it just goes to show. I can blow low when I go low 'cause I'm so fucking good at limbo. Why's the pizza so aggressive, Jimbo?. I don't know, Sheen, I just don't know. What's your favorite medicine?. 'Cause there's nothing better than. Me inside of your butt socks. I hope you're a fan of guys with two cocks. Remember when Poon Patrol was good fun?. Do you remember when I stuck my Donut Stick. Between your Honey Buns?. I want to get on a bike and fly away like I'm E.T. But I can't go outside 'cause the mailman beats me. Why? I don't know, it beats me, but he'll never defeat me. 'Cause i've got the spirit of the dragon. Even if its balls are saggin'. And it's as old as Bob Saget and if I had a tail I'd wag it. And I'd fly really really really far away. Like some deranged half-boy half-dog faggot. And I'd live off the maggots of maggots. Hey do you have any matches? Yeah, sure. Oh no, I'm on fire, I worked for months on these m-m-mustaches. Where's Keanu Reeves when you need him?. Where're the stars when you see them?. Did Nemo's dad really beat him?. Leave it up to the lucky fin, like Barbie and Ken. I'm always askin' myself, when's this verse gonna end?. When my wiener's gonna bend. Far enough back to my butthole. My what hole? Into my motherfuckin' butthole. . Shout out, shout out to myself, for that verse. God damn! God damn! God damn! [?]. Damn, that verse!. Such a good verse, man!. Thanks. . Uh, this is recorded right now, in the present. Some people say I live in America. I just live in the moment. I'm sorry that-- if a lot of those bars were offbeat. I'm only mediocre at rapping sometimes. Thank you for listening to Poon Patrol 2. I hope you enjoyed it. This song, uh, also contains a Michael Jackson sample. But, uh, you can't fuckin' sue me, you're dead. . [Poon Pursuit, 8:43-19:51]. *glass breaks*. Oh fuck! He shot the radio! Shit! Stay calm! We need to stay calm if we have hope to elude this Dog the Bounty Hunter-looking motherfucker. Oh shit!. Where's the money, shit-turd?. Fuck, why is he doing this?.

He's got a beautiful wife that he would give his life for. And he's got a fine-ass dog. Adam catches his wife cheating. How will he achieve his weekly skeeting?. .

I can't believe we made the best movie ever made. Wow. This is great. Oh shit! We lost the entire movie budget when that dog sued us!. How are we going to pay Adam Sandler?. Don't worry about it. I got this Dog the Bounty Hunter-looking motherfucker to pop a cap in that weak-ass Adam Sandler before he can do anything. His ass will be cheese in a fucking cheese grater, we're gonna fucking... we got that guy to kill him and, uh, he's pretty much dead at this point so, uh, that way, we won't have to pay that damn-ass Jew boy Adam Sandler a dime.

And if you want a hard drive you can suck on these nuts. I slap robot butts, I fuck the pussy up in the hacker guts. Fucking QWERTY keyboards, stick 'em in my USB port.

But now, my life is in ruins because Poon Patrol is dead. Poon Patrol is dead! My whole life I have aspired to bring these men to justice and now they are sailing down the river of yams with the Jamaican Death Lord. And I am here, not with Frosty. I am here with my pain, with my sorrows. And I-- Oh no! Fuck! Oh man.... . *ringtone*. I am getting a phone call. Hello? What? What? What?! WHAT?! What are you saying? Are you telling me that Poon Patrol lives?!. Poon Patrol lives!. Ohhhhhh!. Oh! Oh ho ho!. Ohhhhhh!. Ohhhhhh!. It is a good day for Agent Pubes. . [A Rest in India, 19:52-29:58].

Yo, dude, give me a fresh beat, this guy's got us figured out!. Yeah, boy.... . I've been living in India for twenty-two years. Been living in India with twenty-two deers.

Just corny motherfuckers scopin' out these bitches. Catch me wrong and become a narrative to the digit. Send it quick to the wack MC obituary. Diss me on wax and I've leave flowers at your cemetery. Very scary. Like lettin' you live with ripped-off eyelids. Pretty bitch pissin' on your grave just like I did. Rap game Gapalagos 'cause of my own eye lint. Cracker MCs 'round the block but you can't find 'em. Tell Macklemore and G-Eazy that, bitch, I'm right behind 'em. Leave a message, tell the blood splatter not to mind 'em. Remains of the bodies in the sewer where nobody else can find 'em. . I'm hiding in the mall on LSD thinking that I'm Gandhi. Bustin' nuts in the bathroom stalls. Some chick reminds me of Yolandi. 'Cause she got the bangs and the eyes. When I go bang-bang I'm always in disguise. Leave my brand in the game like the backs of cattle. Lookin for trouble? You 'bout to get a drastic battle. You on a high horse, but you ain't got no saddle?. Bitch, I am the shit, all you do is fuckin' dabble. Can't touch me like you the fuckin' pastor. You six feet underground and I'm like the lights at fuckin' NASA. Up in space jerking off the plasma. Foreshadow my demise, always look me in the eyes. Unless you a sucka mothafucka tryin' to get splat. Blow twenty-one cap through your fuckin' Yankees hat. If you really think Poon Patrol ain't all that. Stay the fuck back, stay the fuck back. . Son! You must defeat Poon Patrol or the bad man will come and get you! The bad man will come in your sleep and do very bad things! He will touch you! The bad man will touch you!. . *sirens*. Fuck! The cops! It's the cops!. Don't worry, I can handle these guys. Do you know why I pulled you over, sir?. Uh, what?. You're under arrest for trying to arrest a fucking cop. You're a cop?. Yeah. Uh, that's funny, because you guys look a lot like that Poon Patrol fucker that hired a hitman to kill that Adam Sandler Jew boy, and then escaped to India without a visa. Oh man, that is funny, well it's a good thing I'm just a cop. *gun cocks*. All right, get in the fucking car boys. Uh, yes sir (All right, dude). Shotgun!. Oh shit!. *taser zapping*. Ahhh! Ooh, they got the, the electric...mm, they got the electric fat boys in me. Fuck! Fuck! It doesn't have to be like this! I just wanted the passenger seat! Ohh.... No, get in the fucking trunk, kids. Oh man, I just got slammed into a trunk. . It is me again, Agent Pubes. This time, I am in India. I am seeing the elephants walking around. I am seeing the brown folk on their bikes. The plans are in motion. Poon Patrol will fall to their knees in disgrace. And I will shout out to Buddha, and I will say, "It is me, Agent Pubes, defeater of Poon Patrol!" My mother would be proud, in... in heaven, in the yam fields. I love you, Mama! Mama! I love you! Mama Pubes!. . *ringtone*. Oh man, I am getting a phone call. What? What about the test results? What are you saying? You say I'm not Jamaican? You say I have dick cancer? Nooooooo! Are you telling me that I do really have that cancer in my balls? You say I have less than forty minutes to live? You say that if Poon Patrol does not die by the end of this shitty song, that I will die? No! Mama! Mama Pubes! I can do it! Poon Patrol, hear my cry! You will... fucking die! It's gonna be so metal when I fucking break your bones! When I smash your head in with my Jamaican hammer! It is no problem at all, sir. Thank you for your call. . Haha. I may have dick cancer, but those Poon Patrol fags will have... dead... cancer, when I, when my plans are done. They, they have a few old friends coming their way, I think. Ha! Oh ho ho! Agent Pubes will win again!. . Oh, livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison. Livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison. Livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison.

Lime-green vest when I'm creepin' out the attic. You know who the fuck it is, that good kush activist. Bustin' out the package, bitch. Wonderin' where all the loud-ass cabbage is. Couple mushroom caps to the dome. In the year 3000, everything is chrome. I'm that nasty man doing fuckin' aerobics. Fuck with me and your whole gang gets toasted. 3:17 in the fuckin' afternoon. Add one hour, three minutes, 4:20 bitch. I'mma smoke that weed, I'mma chase that high. 'Cause I'm the finest bitch fuckin' alive. You more like a bee, bitch, stay in your hive. Spray you with my official swag repellent. Will I slice you open? Bitch, there ain't no tellin'. Might fuck around, kill the fuckin' bee. Can't catch my rain when I motherfuckin' sleep. Your girl keep the umbrella for my fuckin' skeet. But there ain't no clouds when I'm out. Never a shortage, never a drought. When I toke that dope in the baggy. Beans on the block, pockets get saggy. You know I smoke that good, shawty know I keep that wood. I add weight to the game like cinder blocks. The day I'm out is the day there's a crack in this rock. Step up to the block like, "What's good, officer, like, no. I ain't got no fuckin' weed up in my socks. I ain't have any weed up in my socks". . Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt.

You must kill them! You must stab them!. You must defeat Poon Patrol!. . Eatin' pussy all day long. I was eatin' pussy when I wrote this song. Been running through these hoes like we're running out of hoes. And I'm suckin' off my bros like we're running out of bros. And I'm gonna smoke some weed and hit that blunt. Hold up, shawty, let me hit it from the front. And I'm gonna suck that dick and hit that sack. Hold up, bro, let me hit it from the back. And I'll kiss your mom on her mouth. And I'll kiss your dad down south. Suck my dad's dick like I didn't come from it. And I'll eat his ass like he doesn't shit from it. Oh, man, this beat is oriental. And eatin' pussy is quintessential. All my clothes are hand-me-downs. Because I like to keep the jeans in the family. And I only like to fuck my family. Because I like to keep the genes in the family. . I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life. I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life. I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life. I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life. . Cyber pussy in my veins. Digital dickery in my brains. All you gotta say to get into these shorts. Is "hey, what's up," I throw my nuts up. I fuck your butt up, I fuck it down. Eating pussy like a pussy-eating clown. And if you don't associate with these sorts. My dick will distort you, like Sandler distorts Jews. I was born hard, when I go to hell, because I am a freak. I'll probably enjoy it, because I am a freak. Of course it's theoretical. Unlike the way I wreck your genitals. Sandy Hook was a tragedy, it was fucked up. But shut up, shawty, gotta hit it from the front. Gettin' my nut!. . I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life. I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life. I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life. I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life. . Yeah, the beat goes hard, like suckin' dudes' dicks. 'Cause it ain't against the law. What? Sorry, shawty, I guess I let my tongue fuckin' slip. Yeah, I mix the crack in my Fun Dip. Yeah, I've got a fun clique, all we do is smoke zips. Pop zits, and fuck clits. When I'm getting my nut off. Wondering if R. Kelly's butt's soft. While I'm sliding in. Wondering when Dennis Rodman's gonna come riding in. [?] diving in, or some rimjob poon. Yeah, I've fucking slewn all that fucking poon. Yeah, I play fucking bassoon because I'm in a fucking cocoon. I'm a raccoon eating on some poon. I fuck your girl butt naked with my harpoon, and my bassoon. . [?]. Stop bein' a dick, Scott!. . Konnichiwa, we have arrived in China. Just in time, the rocket's about to launch. Come on, boys!. Rocket launch in five...four...three...two.... . Rise if you would.... Yo, I step up to the mic, I hit that fuckin' weed. Is it recording?. Yeah. Shit.... . We'll be entering deep space in six, nine... haha!. Oh, man.... . [2069: A Spacey Odyssey, 43:50-51:19]. I'm complacent in my own spaceship. Told the age-old never to weigh shit. On some underpaid arcade chips. Calm, collecting karma sauce and in the splatter. Vacant crime scene, snuck a shook look. From the neck to the bladder. Young hearts ain't the only ones who shatter. Pacin' spaceship on the beat, never wear no Asics on my feet. Adidas on the street, like Peter countin' sheep. Always kept the nine on his blanket. After twelve is when he would get paintin'. White walls on those dark rows. May [?] to get that shark's gold. Warm shoulders get cold. Always leapt for the stars, now I think my asteroid's got mold. Like microwave dinner that ain't get sold. Keep ninety-five beehives in my wallet. Don't, dangerous, what I call it?. Whose life, and how much it costin'?. New house, codeine out the faucet. No furniture, new chick dick curvature. This sick shit like it's Bad Motherfucker Overture. New whip slips over curves, my hand dips over hers. My feet off the pedal, we flyin' heavy metal. New vibrato, top model, love module. No stem, told me I got you, laser tag I shot you. Daffy Duck do-rag when Poppy pops you. You're blowin' dandelions if you really think I'mma spot you. . Yo teach, remember me? All the classes I was failing in?. Now I'm on a space beach, tokin' with the aliens. The nebulous strain, zero G's on the brain. Fuck the President, my residence in Sector Pain, Quadrant 69. I've always wanted to fuck a star. Get my asteroids off while I'm spittin' space bars. The Wi-Fi sucks but the view's not bad. I'm entering Uranus while I dab. In space there's nothin' to hold me down. Nothin' to restrain me from unleashin' on these clowns. I might have Down's (Bitch, what the fuck?). I seriously might have Down's. Space Down's. . No license, backseat, flip phone buzzin'. No brakes until the 5-0 fuckin' fuzzin'. God's trek, belongs full of God's breath, God's chest. Drippin' judgment, best bet, mullet, suit, bulletproof. Vest stain on some stinky ass breath. Roomba rollin' 'round the graveyard, bumpin' Cyndi Lauper. While I'm in Qatar, bump her caboose. Now I'm feelin loose, alligator. Forged full of lies like paperback newspaper. [?] with the friendly saber-tooth liger. Get your daughter and hide her. In a cell, only her and a fuckin' tiger. Ask her about her vices. You're life's about as dense as a bowl of fuckin' rice is. Space is nice, shiz, nothin' to do but burn bowls. Finally, a location to reflect my soul. . Ooh! Ooooh! Having-- I'm having fun on this spaceship. Space is big. Man, it's big. So anyway, Car Seat Fuckshit, why'd you bring us up here in space on your big spaceship?. So I could kill you. Haha. What?! What?! What?. . I'd say my plan is sick. I'll tell you because you're ready for this Car Seat Dick. . When I heard you were alive I was filled with fear. Another Poon Patrol album would end my career. I was looking for some indie clothes in Indian Sears. When I saw the two cashiers comin' from the rear. Now I knew that if I killed you then and there I'd go to jail. But if I took you to out space then the plan could never fail. Aliens don't have laws (Aliens don't use laws). Now I knew that two dank fellows half as cool as you guys. Wouldn't cross the border with a fucker such as I. So I called the cops on you so that I could pull a bust. The only way for me to seem dank enough to trust. So I could take you out to China and shoot us into space. Somewhere with the privacy to take my place in history. Like John Wilkes Booth with an indie affectation. I'm a quirky god, I'm an internet sensation (Sensation). Internet sensation (Sensation). Sensation (Sensation). Sensation (Sensation). The only internet sensation. . Uh, get ready to die, motherfuckers! Here I go!. *gunshots*. Bam! Bam! Oh!. Oh shit! It's Adam Sandler!. Yeah, I'm that Sandler. Thanks for saving us, Adam Sandler! It's really good to see you!. . Cut the shit man, get the F out of my face. It's time for bars, time to put you in your place. You think I came to help you make a shifty Jew escape. But I came to blow your brains out and then shoot you into space. Been twenty-two years since your hitman shot me. The damage was so critical that now I've got robot feet. Nobody wants to see a movie featuring a freak. I was homeless in the street, I was eating rats for weeks. One day I got a call from my manager, Pubes. Told me Poon Patrol was still kickin', still smokin' doobs. I was pleased, even though at the time, I was pissing. From a man in the shitter to a man with a mission. Saw you gettin' on the rocket so I hid inside the cargo. I had a lot of time, so I popped in Fargo. Car Seat Head-Ass got no game. He slay pee-pee, bitch, no way. . When your follicles all fall to fossil, leagues beneath the sand. Everything you are will disappear beneath my funny hand. I'm a silly man, with a fucked-up plan, stop me if you can. I'll fill Netflix with movies called The World's Chinkest Man. By Adam Sandler, maybe one will even have a star. Maybe you'll be a star too. When I throw you out the airlock and move to the moon. Lotsa time to contemplate the time. I took the lives of Poon Patrol. In my vortex psyche I will seal control. Basking in the glory of the kill!. Car Seat Fuckshit, stupid plan's unfulfilled. As he died, wishing he could do the things to you that I will. You'll never be half the meme that I am, bitch!. You're along the lines of the Kool-Aid pitcher dude. Or the Pink Panther. I'm still Adam Sandler. I'm Adam Sandler, motherfuckers!. Get ready to die! Here I go, haha!. You guys are fucked! (Hey, man, I'm thinkin' we hit that self-destruct button and get in the escape pod). I'm about to do it! (Yeah, boy!). Yeah! Yeah! Whoo, whoo... What?! WHAT?! NOOO!!. *explosion*. . Oh shit, we killed Adam Sandler. Oh man! Oh man! Oh man! Oh man!. What can I say about Adam Sandler?. He was in movies. He did make jokes. Waterboy? Little Man? Big Dad, Eight Crazy Nights?. Grown Ups 2? Paul Blart, Mall Cop?. They're all movies. They're all movies. Fuck!. He should be called Adam Sandman!. Dude, if I'm being honest, like, fuck that dude. I'm so glad we got that motherfucker off of us. Like...seriously. Adam Sandler? That-- You're glad we killed him?. Yep. Dude, I feel the same way. Fuck that guy. Fuck him, dude. He was trying to kill us. Yeah, we killed that guy. We killed the funniest, the most unfunny man.... Really bad at rapping. Not a funny guy. But we murdered him. Fuck Adam Sandler. Yeah, fuck him. You know, I say, we go out.... [?] a bandana, maybe a scarf.... We go down to the flea circus.... Dude, this escape pod is heading straight for the sun. Oh fuck!. . [Sillycide, 51:20-60:00]. Dying doesn't feel as bad when you're famous. And you've got four cars and your fortune, gold bars, son. Counting up the profits on your way to stardom. I'll probably make it in the Guiness. With Ratatouille as witness. If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?. Will the world know how baller I fucked around?. If you want to be famous like me. But you can't do shit but smoke weed. Just kill yourself and get on TV (420 blaze it). Or be a genius with great genes. Pumpin' out ten ten-out-of-ten mixtapes popped up on lean. Do one or the other but I've got both covered. Postmortem platinum, big shot to the maximum, yes. Death is nothing, really, when you're walking on the silly side. Death is a basic bitch, when you made this based shit. And you're smokin' that laced shit. Everyone's gotta go, I guess I'm just a guest in limbo. Shaggy and Scooby, tryin' to crack the mystery. Of what's livin' within this Dominican doobie. Life is a fad, at least I had an aesthetic. Everything is easy when you've got an aesthetic. Mind games, I'm hooked on ironic brand names. And when I was twelve, I beat Through the Fire and Flames. So I got that going for me. Too bad I couldn't die alone at forty. Damn, we must be breakin' the speed limit. Space cops wishin' we survived to pay the ticket. But dopamine is infinite and dying doesn't feel that bad. Dying doesn't feel that bad. . Outer space ship spray LSD laced mace clit, pause, bitch!. Bust a nut, put my dick in the peanut butt-er, asteroid clutter. Wastin' afternoon, fuckin' jacking off to Flubber. Cum on my coattail, in a Chevy motel. Fake plastic trees, and a plain white tee. Nothin' on TV, no reachable signal. Fuck Ween, drink more fuckin' Pepto-Bismol. Deer skin cape, listenin' to Drake. Pretendin' I listen to Drake, bitch, I don't listen to Drake. Who are we? A couple shits who's playin' in the kudzu. Bitch, if you are a bubble then I did not mean to bust you. 'Cause if you're yelling "fuck me" and I'm screaming "fuck you". If you're actin' [?] I might just have to dunk you. Sorry, it's really hard to trust you. How you think I got in this fuckin' spaceship?. Are you even there? Think I'm going apeshit. Staring at the wall of this aluminum ball. Hallucination, illumination, etch in my eyelid. You didn't get as fucked up as I did. Headin' for the sun, ready for the run of this life. The thrill of the scene to absorb with the rainbow beams. I'm more than a meme, I'm not ready to leave. I'm not ready to die. . Leavin' behind shawties from bamboo to Cancun. Goodbye to Wisconsin, goodbye to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Hello to the sun's magnificent flames. Dougied with Satan and learned we had the same names. Yuh, he told me to tell the few still hatin'. That I been spittin' bars since Lindsay Lohan. And the pipe were fuckin' datin'. I'm another planet's favorite star. Catch me with some intergalactic space ghouls. Givin' away permanent vacations to these second-place fools. Just saw a mouse on a dirty satellite. Fuck the game butt-naked, in the candlelight. You all a bunch of clones like "hoy minoy minoy". Drown you with drones, you stay sleepin' with the koi. Bitch, what the fuck? Get the fuck out of my face with that four-dimensional arcade bullshit. Fuck you. . Dude, it sucks that we're dying. But, you know, at the end of the day, I'm glad that I was one of the three members of Poon Patrol. Yeah (Yeah). Oh man, it's been such a pleasure bein' part of Poon Patrol. Man, I remember bein' down back at the Chinese liquor store. Man, man, I remember that Jew boy, Adam Sandler. It's been a real pleasure workin' with Poon Patrol. Thank you, Egg Boy! You are a very great friend!. Haha, ha! What are you guys talkin' about?. Yeah, boy!. . Time dilation, final breath (Sunshine). Ego inflation, ego death (Sunshine). Poon Patrol in the sky. Goodbye. . Said look at me, now, now, look at you. Split myself in half just to split myself in two. Don't know what to do, good sweet death, guess that's my cue. Catch you back in a few, bust a nut in her tooth. Right before I leave the earth, eat her ass, eat the dirt. Put on her skirt, then I fuckin' skrt. In the last callous, in my metallic palace. Closer to the spicy-ass sun. Hand on my gun, point it at the sun. Let it go bang, let it go bang bang, let it go bang. Point it at the sun, let it go bang. Let it go bang bang, let it go bang. Let it go bang, let it go bang bang, let it go bang. Point it at the sun, let it go bang. Let it go bang bang, let it go bang. . No exception, death fucks us all, always answers the call. I'm a good catch, erection past his motherfuckin' balls. He lifts up his scythe as I lay down the motherfuckin' mic. Catch you on the flip side, motherfuckers!. Let it go bang, let it go bang bang, let it go bang. Point it at the sun, let it go bang. Let it go bang bang, let it go bang. . Ahh, ow, ouch! Aaah! I'm on fire! Ouch! I'm on fire, bitch!

Once again, the day is saved by Agent Pubes. My doctor does tell me that I only have two minutes to live, but I do not care. I do not care. Poon Patrol is dead and I can die content and join my mother in the yam fields of Jamaican Heaven. Oh yes, now I can die. Here I go. Here I go! Time to die! Time to f...time to die. *ringtone*. Oh, what is this? I am getting a phone call. Hello?. What the fuck, man?! What the fuck, man?!Embed
