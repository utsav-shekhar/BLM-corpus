Don't know why I'm still afraid. If you weren't real I would make you up now. I wish that I could follow through. I know that your love is true, and deep, as the sea. . [Pre-Chorus]. But right now, everything you want is wrong. And right now, all your dreams are waking up. And right now, I wish I could follow you. To the shores, of freedom, where no one lives. [Verse 2]. Remember when we first met. And everything was still a bet. In love's game. . You would call, I'd call you back. And then I'd leave. A message. On your answering machine. . [Pre-Chorus 2]. But right now, everything is turning blue. And right now, the sun is trying to kill the moon. And right now, I wish I could follow you. To the shores, of freedom, where no one lives. . [Chorus]. Freedom. Run away tonight. Freedom. Freedom. Run away. Run away tonight. . [Verse 3]. We're made out of blood and rust. Looking for someone to trust. Without, a fight. You might also likeI think that you came too soon. You're the honey and the moon. That lights. Up my night. . [Pre-Chorus]. But right now, everything you want is wrong. And right now, all your dreams are waking up. And right now, I wish that I could follow you. To the shores, of freedom, where no one lives. . [Chorus]. Freedom. Run away tonight. Freedom. Freedom. Run away. Run away tonight. . [Bridge]. We got too much time to kill. Like pigeons on my windowsill. We hang around. . Ever since I've been with you. You hold me up. All the time. I've falling down. [Pre-Chorus 2]. But right now, everything is turning blue. And right now, the sun is trying to kill the moon. And right now, I wish I could follow you. To the shores, of freedom, where no one lives. . [Chorus]. Freedom. Run away tonight. Freedom. Freedom. Run away. Run away tonight1Embed
