You'll get this now. Oh yeah. Haha, ha. I’ma get this now. And I'ma take mine just to get mine. . [Verse 1]. You think, I know. Wide eyes got a narrow scope. You think that they'd know. Not to shoot a man while he on the floor. That’s why these youngins they run before talkin' to police because they know the deal. See young Trayvon Martin had just left the market with candy and got his ass killed. [Chorus]. No more excuses. We must refuse this. Silence is useless. Long live the innocent. They tell us stories. Of star-spangled glory. This is your warning. Long live the innocent. Whoa, oh, oh (Oh yeah). Whoa, oh, oh (Oh yeah). Oh, oh, oh (Oh yeah). Long live the innocent. Hey hey. Oh yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah. Yeah. . [Verse 2]. Eyes of the law do not (They don't). Look anything like my own (Not like mine). I can see clearly now (What they look like?). That the arraignment is gone. Yes I did go head up with that cop tryna do me like Radio Raheem (Take me to him). I looked at the judge, said "I feared for my life and I pray that you'll do the right thing".

All they know is what you show them. . [Chorus]. No more excuses. We must refuse this. Silence is useless. Long live the innocent. They tell us stories. Of star-spangled glory. This is your warning. Long live the innocent. Whoa, oh, oh (Oh yeah). Whoa, oh, oh (Oh yeah). Oh, oh, oh (Oh yeah). Long live the innocent. Whoa, oh, oh. Whoa, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Long live the innocentEmbed
