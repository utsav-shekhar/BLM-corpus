Often, I am upset. That I cannot fall in love, but I guess. This avoids the stress of falling out of it. Are you tired of me yet?. I'm a little sick right now but I swear. When I'm ready I will fly us out of here. . [Chorus]. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I'll cut my hair. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). To make you stare. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I'll hide my chest. And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. [Verse 2]. Turn off your porcelain face. I can't really think right now and this place. Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane. Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead. 'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head. But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet. . [Chorus]. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). My eyes went dark. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I don't know where. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). My pupils are. But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here. . [Bridge]. Get a load of this monster. He doesn't know how to communicate. His mind is in a different place. Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?. Get a load of this train wreck. His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet. But little do we know, the stars. Welcome him with open arms. Oh. You might also like[Outro]. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). Time is. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). Slowly. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). Tracing his face. But strangely he feels at home in this place81Embed
