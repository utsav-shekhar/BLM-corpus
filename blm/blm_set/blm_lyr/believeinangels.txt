Where the shadow ends, so begins the dream. Where the hunger leads me, it's hard to believe. I'll be lost in/to you. . It's the blood that ties, it's the hurt that heals. It's the face you hide, hides the pain you feel. So hold me up now, yeah, I'm afraid to breathe. And I'm lost in/to you, yeah, (I'm) lost in/to you. . I believe in a heaven, I believe in the night. I believe there's a path we/to follow, I believe in the light. Part of you is the devil, part of you is the light. You're/I'm gonna fly through the city of angels. Hold me under, let the river wash away my sins. Let me drown in/and you, let the water and the love rush you. You can hear me whisper when you're listening. And I'm lost in/to you, yeah, (I'm) lost in/to you. I believe in a heaven, I believe in the night. I believe there's a path we/to follow, I believe in the light. Part of you is the devil, part of you is the light. You're/I'm gonna fly through the city of angels. . It's the blood that ties, it's the hurt that heals. It's the face you hide, hides the pain you feel. So hold me up now, I long to believe. And I'm lost in/to you, yeah, (I'm) lost in/to you. . I believe in a heaven, I believe in the night. I believe there's a path we/to follow, I believe in the light. Part of you is the devil, part of you is the light. You're/I'm gonna fly through the city of angelsYou might also likeEmbed
