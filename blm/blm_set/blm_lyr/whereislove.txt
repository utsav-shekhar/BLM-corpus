I had a question to ask the world. I asked "where is love?". I was told love is understanding, truth, and peace of mind. Satisfaction of soul, and sometimes it's being kind. . Until by a hermit I was told. He said "son, there’s no one born of woman can tell you from self. You must go out into the world and find out for yourself". . So I'll go on in this life in search of love and happiness. Until I find this thing called love. I'll search for it in the daytime. I’ll look for it late at night. And if I find it sometime I'm gonna wonder if it's wrong or right. Oh love. (Oh love). Oh love. (Oh love). Where is love?. (I don't know, I don't know). Oh love. (Oh love). Oh love. (Oh love). Somebody tell me where is love. (I don't know, I don't know). . You can look for it in the daytime. You can search for it late at night. Oh you bet your bottom dollar baby, if you find it you better hold on tight. Some people look for it in the nighttime. Some people even go to church. But just like the hermit told me, you're gonna find it in your heart first. . Oh love. (Oh love). Oh love. (Oh love). Where is love?. (I don’t know, I don’t know). . Oh love. (Oh love). Oh love. (Oh love). Somebody tell me where is love. (I don't know, I don’t know). You might also likeYou know, in the day's time. It's hard to tell where there is love. There's so much lying, cheating and deceiving. That you can look at a friend, and he’ll smile and be lying. And where there is truth, there is love. Where there is love there is truth. Where there is lies there is nothing. So I'm gonna tell you, go out and find it. It's very hard to find. . Oh love. (Oh love). Oh love. (Oh love). Where is love?. (I don't know, I don't know). . Oh love. (Oh love). Oh love. (Oh love). Somebody tell me where is love. (I don't know, I don't know)Embed
