. [Verse 1]. Last night was a car crash. Highlights meet a quick end. Live the high life 'fore the weekends. Coming down hard to the sunset sinking in. Didn't try hard for a diehard. Nothing I can say that you won't get wrong. And everybody asks where you're gone now. Can you only really want what you don't have enough?. Everything you ever wanted adding up. To be the reason you can't stand it now. You talk a lot, well act like it. Finally found a way to get myself untangled. And undone, but it's alright. This ain't been the dream in a long time. Make sure you play the music when my time's up. Oh, just say it, I'm done. [Chorus]. So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?. 'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most. But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world. Some say these things are for the best. How are you so sure?. . [Verse 2]. And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars. I'll get there someday. I hope you find everything you think that you want. Bruises will fade. Time on our side, we can wait for it. I'll be doing fine, if you are. 'Cause life is but a dream. Only as real as you let it be. . [Chorus]. So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?. 'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most. But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world. Some say these things are for the best. For better or worseYou might also like31Embed
