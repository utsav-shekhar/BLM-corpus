I've been hurt and fucked up too. Many years ago. Hopin' I could come up quick. Along the broken road. . [Pre-Chorus]. Well, I hustled and found a plug (Found a plug). Front me extra, show me love. Now I'm flexin' in a Wraith. They hatin' on me too. [Chorus]. And every sleepless night. Led me to where I am. Bitches that broke my heart. They became hoes that scam. Show me a better way. Promise I'll quit this game. This much I know, it's true. I came up and so could you. And fuck the boys in blue. . [Post-Chorus]. Fuck 'em all. Fuck 12, fuck 12. Fuck 12, fuck 12. . [Verse 2]. Blow the money, act a fool. Baguettes my proof. Brought my niggas, put 'em on. I promise I won't lose. . [Pre-Chorus]. Well, I hustled and found a plug (Found a plug). Front me extra, show me love. Now I'm flexin' in a Wraith. They hatin' on me too. You might also like[Chorus]. And every sleepless night. Led me to where I am. Bitches that broke my heart. They became hoes that scam.
