You're saying everything I like. I could watch ya lips move all night. Makin' me think you might. Have the type of brain I like. Promise I'ma make it rain for you. Somethin' like an ocean wave on you. If you let me open up to you. Kiss below the line. . [Chorus]. I wanna see what your head game like. Do you know what you're doin'?. Is your neck game tight?. Do you know how to use it?. Have a long conversation with me. I talk back, baby, we can get deep. I wanna see what your head game like. Do you know what you're doin'?. Is your neck game tight?. Do you know how to use it?. Have a long conversation with me. If you love swimming under the sea. Then dive, dive. Ooh, dive. [Verse 2]. I wanna see you rock the boat. Back and forth, lick the beach. Fuck the shore, make me scream. All aboard, don't sink. I'ma be laid back, legs cracked. Watch your face, entertain my lap. If I like that we gon' keep it on repeat. . [Chorus]. I just wanna see what your head game like. Do you know what you're doin'?. Is your neck game tight?. Do you know how to use it?. Have a long conversation with me. I talk back, baby, we can get deep. I wanna see what your head game like. Do you know what you're doin'?. Is your neck game tight?. Do you know how to use it?. Have a long conversation with me. If you love swimming under the sea. Then dive, dive. Ooh, dive. . [Instrumental Outro]You might also like9Embed
