I wanna jump the fence and wash my face in the creek. But I'm black myself. I wanna sweep that gal right off her feet. But I'm black myself. Tired of walkin' 'round with no shoes on. But I'm black myself. Your precious God ain't gonna bless me. 'Cause I'm black myself. . [Chorus]. Is you washed in the blood of your chattel?. 'Cause the lamb's rotted away. When they stopped shipping work horses. Bred your own anyway. [Verse 2]. I don't pass the test of the paper bag. 'Cause I'm black myself. I pick the banjo up and they stare at me. 'Cause I'm black myself. You better lock your doors when I walk by. 'Cause I'm black myself. You look me in my eyes but you don't see me. 'Cause I'm black myself. . [Chorus]. They're washed in the blood of the chattel. 'Cause the lamb's rotted away. When they stopped shipping work horses. They bred their own anyway. . [Verse 3]. I don't creep around, I stand proud and free. 'Cause I'm black myself. I go anywhere that I wanna go. 'Cause I'm black myself. I'm surrounded many lovin' arms. 'Cause I'm black myself. And I'll stand my ground and smile in your face. 'Cause I'm black myself. You might also like[Chorus]. I washed away my blood and tears. I've been born brand new. There's no more work horses. But there's still work to do. . [Outro]. 'Cause I'm black myself (Black myself). 'Cause I'm black myself (Black myself). 'Cause I'm black myself (Black myself). 'Cause I'm black myself. Black my–, black my–, black myselfEmbed
