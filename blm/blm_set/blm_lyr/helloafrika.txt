Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!. [Verse 1]. Hello Nigeria! - That's my Motherland. Coming to Sweden now - causin' hysteria. Takes a long time to travel the globe. So why be shy? Why be humble?. I just came straight out the jungle. You can't compete with me. Cause you know I got the rhythm. I did it before and I'll do it again. So listen watcha say, yeah, hear my point of view. Not everyone can do this, in fact only a few Sophisticated, heart created. That's who I am. You know I've been waiting. So start pumping - make some noise!. . The Mandika tribe, the Hausa tribe. The Fulani tribe, the Gooya tribe, the Zulu tribe. Mi no live in a house - mi live in a tree. Electricity can give you a shock. Mi no smoke no cig - mi no take no coke. All me take is a glass of juice. . [Chorus]. Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!. You might also like[Verse 2]. I'm calling on the big guys from the pyramid top. To join bits and pieces of our Fatherland - Afrika. Cause without boundaries we can move the mountains. Drop your personal individual ambitions. Chase the devil off and purify our Fatherland. Afrikan people, crawl from your vultures, stand affirm. 'Cause you are the aura of mankind. You are the dreams, you are the hope. You are the future, you are the past. You are the grandfather of civilization. That is why ANC want old dog to sit. . The impossible just takes a little longer. Out of this world and into another world. The earth is spinning round and there's so much to discover. The afrikan man seems to be everywhere. If there are people in the world. Who knows that right is never wrong. Stop the fire burning in my home - Afrika. Martin Luther King, Mandela - you had a dream. Self-evidence and quality for men. Afrika for me and Afrika for you de Klerk. It doesn't really matter whether a cat is black or white. What really matter is to catch the mouse. I'd rather do it in an afrikan way. Hello Afrika tell me how you're doin'!. [Leila K.]. Mmm, jumping on the mic. 'Cause me a rockin' up affection. When I'm holdin' me a mic. 'Cause me awesome affections. What you say to me? Me a fun and me warm. Spend fi de mi a time on the "tresittia" dime. Don't you try to follow me. You ought to realize it. What me are, what me a really want. Me not fly, no I am just coolin'. Come on now - just et it off!. . [Chorus]. Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!. . [Verse 3]. I have been mourning, I have been grieving. I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes. There's a hottie, hottie wind blowing south to north. Following on my head, drying all my plants. If there's a mercy in the clouds. You know right is never wrong?. Move the sadist off my back. And stop the fire burning in my home - Afrika. Here comes the news from mighty Lord. Transqualation is about to come to Earth, right. Rapping is digging down river from north to south. To let milk & honey flow side to side. . My name is Alban, mi is a dentist. Mi DJ here, mi DJ there. Mi have a shop on Slojdgatan. Alphabet St. is da name. Mi live in no house, mi live in a flat. Electricity can give you a shock. Mi smoke no cig, mi take no coke. All me takes is a glass of juice. . [Chorus]. Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Afrika - Tell me how you're doin'!. Hello Motherland - Tell me how you're doin'!Embed
