Come all of you good workers. Good news to you I'll tell. Of how the good ol' union. Has come in here to dwell. . [Chorus]. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?. . [Verse 2]. My daddy was a miner. And I'm a miner's son. And I'll stick with the union. 'Til every battle's won. [Chorus]. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?. . [Verse 3]. They say in Harlan County. There are no neutrals there. You'll either be a union man. Or a thug for J. H. Blair. . [Chorus]. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?. . [Verse 4]. Oh workers can you stand it?. Oh tell me how you can. Will you be a lousy scab. Or will you be a man?. . [Chorus]. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?. . [Verse 5]. Don't scab for the bosses. Don't listen to their lies. Us poor folks haven't got a chance. Unless we organize. You might also like[Chorus]. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?. Which side are you on?2Embed
