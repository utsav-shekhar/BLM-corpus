. I am. A magical, mystical manifestation of life. I am. A professional, powerful lyricist grabbin the mic. I can. Imagine a world where all boys and girls. Have a reason to live. I stand. For justice, equality. Present and past what was and what is. I am. [Verse 1: Maya Jupiter]. . Guiding the ships to shores. In the still of the night. Beams of light. Reflecting. On the past and the stories held. Beneath my waters. Marauders fell. Deep. I am eternally yours. Hand in the jaws. Yearning for freedom just because. It brings me. Closer to the omnipotent one. Love is a tumble that’s second to none. I stumble and get right up back upon. My feet screaming the words I’ve heard. I shall overcome. Retreat. Never an option. Stay with concoctions. Love and honesty, truth eruptions. Combining power to kill corruption. Still never missing a beat. You might also like[Chorous]. . I am. A magical, mystical manifestation of life. I am.

I am. . [Verse 2: Maya Jupiter]. . I am... The shining star. Held by a crescent moon. Bright (brillante). At high noon. Prayers resonating illuminating. Through the mist of misjudgement. I endeavour for peace. I sing through the voice of the wind. I dream with the hills and the streams. Release me. Into a place where truth lies. See me inside. The eyes of a child. Many miles deep from within the earth. I smile. Patiently waiting. Holding my breath. Feeling the beauty in stillness and depth. Life flows through my body. I know Its something Godly. [Chorous]. .

Strength is built and I can not go back. Held by my neck, carried by slack. And broken backs that never grew weak. Folklore sung when forbidden to speak. Hidden identities not how its meant to be. I am forever who I am eternally. Grateful and gracious and patience protects. The future unfolds in a new dialect. As i clutch to the words trying hard to affect. Ink disappears and I can not connect. New crop’s harvest, I must yield. Deep asleep in the old corn fields. Ready to waken the spirit of youth. Powerfully present persistently Truth. I AmEmbed
