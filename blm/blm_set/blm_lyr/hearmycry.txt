This is our time, this is our shine. Yeah, yeah, uh, uh. . Verse 1:. Musical vigilante, I pray they understand me. I took my pain and then I turned that shit into a NAMMY. I do this for my momma, I'm rapping for my granny. I'll take a Native story, turn that shit into a GRAMMY. . Musical alchemy, I see the world in panoramic. Young, educated Native make a White Man panic. Lakota lead a white? The Government would shot me. They treated our chiefs the same way that they treat Gaddafi. And no, I ain't a copy. Rapping is not a hobby. I am not the exception, I'd never been a probably (?). I'm aiming for their heart, even if my bow is wobbly. We'll storm the White House, have a Nake concert in the lobby. . I let my grades sway, before my culture die. I let my heart bleed, I consult the sky. I ask my grandfather "Why?" as I say my cry. They say "Lakota boy, time to defend or die!". . {​​​Chorus:}​​​. (Cody Blackbird singing Native, flutes). Please take me home, while my people die. My heart beats on, Grandfather hear my cry. . Frank:. One more time, I'm going in. Yeah, yeah. . Verse 2:. I was born red, stained with the blood of genocide. Now all mascots the only way that I'm identified. Blackhawk, Red Skin, the image of our dead men. Dressed in the headdress, my people it's depressing. . Addressing our ills, I want my Black Hills back. The Government wants me dead, but I never will crack. Feel that, you all feeling like it's our time?. All I gotta say, "FUCK THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE.". You might also likeI'm praying for the knowledge to make it through college. With the world on my back, yo the challenge is ours. The path will be found for those who stray. And the answers will come to those who pray. . It's like, damn, tell my why we rape our women?. Degrade our women? And forsake our living?. My mama raised me all by herself. I think of her struggle, and I find a reason for help. . Reason to live when my people are my reason to die. I'm tryna fight cause our ails are my reason to cry. Reason for life? I ain't got a reason to lose. Because my motivation is the same reason they boost. . Reasons why? Put 'em high. Put your bows up. All my real rappers for the people. Put your flows up. . It's time to grow up. It's time to overstand. (Unknown line). I am your common man. . {​​​Chorus:}​​​Embed
