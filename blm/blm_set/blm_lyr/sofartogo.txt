[Intro: D'Angelo]. I wanna get closer to you baby. . [Hook: D'Angelo]. You have come so far, you've got so far to go (yeah). You have come so far, you've got so far to go (yeah). . [Verse 1: Common]. Let go and let me live inside you. What your mouth don't say baby your thighs do. I want us to arrive together. I love it when the weather. Is wet and sticky, some depict me. As being conscious, yeah I use my head. It was you that fed, my appetite for seduction. Biting and cussing, making love and uh. Touching where no one has ever touched before. The heat, got you open like an oven door. Because of your innocence. Even more you'll remember this hardcore gentleness. Before you wasn't into this. On the ride, your freak became limitless. Holding on to the night and me tight. As we write on the walls a story called "Go!". [Hook: D'Angelo]. You have come so far, you've got so far to go. You have come so far, you've got so far to go. . [Verse 2: Common]. I love it when we do it. You do it like you believe it. Able to give and receive it with openness. Emotions just spill. I'm giving you something that you can feel. It's hard to stay still. Rubbing your desires up against mine. I feel you shakin, I'm thinkin that next time. My fingers on the hook of your neck. Deep in your eyes is a look of respect. Soft wet brown sugar, mixed with cinnamon. Said you learning to trust men again. If this is love, made our self. Is made for you to feel empowered at the same time helpless. You dealt with a lot and your screams and moans. Something bout you go off that I see I'm home. For we don't have to think no more. It's synchronicity and raw. And this is what I came here for. .
