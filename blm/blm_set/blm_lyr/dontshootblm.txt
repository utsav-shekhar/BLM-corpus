(I can't breathe… they gon’ kill me. They gonna kill me man…).  . [Intro]. The concept of equality is a lie. The color of my skin make it hard for me to survive. I'm dealing with this hatred deep inside. For this matrix we inside. Its 2020 I'm still dealing with racist. That hate that we alive. And it hurt me we to ignorant. To see they straight then we divide. So focused on building places that we can thrive. Empower one another put the hatin’ beef aside. Look, Black men we still in war outside. Couldn't help it. When I watched them kill Floyd I cried. Frustrated, killin' all our soldiers. Reality, television still in all our focus. I don't wanna be another rest in peace tat. Cause the laws chose my neck to rest his knee at. And my prayers and condolences to the family of. Breonna Taylor murdered but no officers arrested. This is lawless. We protested this is life in America. When they shoot us cause they scared of us. Marchin' looking for justice. But them people never cared for us. I'm dark skin racism is certain for me. I'm living in a pessimistic purgatory. You heard the story.  . [Chorus]. Don't shoot…. They already got me handcuffed on the flo’. Laying faced down but you give me some mo’. That's why we keep on screaming fuck the police fo’. (Fuck the police fo'). Don't shoot…. I'm tryna to make it back home to my kids. Instead I’m being shot. Don't even know what I did. Bad as you wanna kill me. That's how bad I wanna live. ( Is how bad I wanna live).  . [Verse 2]. What about my children. What the hell can I tell them. When they scared of police. That keep asking for peace. I'm teaching my son. How to act in the presence of the law. As a young black male. But his scared as can be. Got a question if the color of his skin. Is enough to breed hatred. From a gun wielding racist. Who thinks it's right to shoot niggas. For absolutely no reason. Unarmed and black they wanna see us bleeding. I say if they not with us. They get rolled over. We pressing bout white privilege. They give cold shoulders. They country in conflict. We give no soldiers. Practice group economics. Give what's our the most focus. If we can keep pressing. Til it's justice for Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. Breonna Taylor, Justin Howell, Jamel Floyd. We never forgot about Mike Brown, Tamir Rice. Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sandra bland. Philando Castil. It's too many lives lost. Them rounds get fired off. They kill them in cold blood. And all they get is fired or time off. They mock us in demonstration. And probably defend the hatred. And elected a bigot for president. Was the biggest statement. I see I'm staking claim to a stolen land. A hostage in the land of the free. That's how we manage to be. I feel like being black put the token on me. Your pardons I'm jogging. I'm a artist only don't shoot.  . [Chorus]. Don't shoot…. they already got me handcuffed on the flo”. Laying faced down but you give me some mo'. That's why we keep on screaming fuck the police fo'. (Fuck the police fo').  Don't shoot…. I'm tryna to make it back home to my kids. Instead I'm being shot, Don't even know what I did. Bad as you wanna kill me. That's how bad I wanna live. ( Is how bad I wanna live).  . [Verse 3]. Listen, as long as our skin's black police guns flex. Used to kill us with only guns now it's knees on necks. In danger to lose your life. When no crime been done. Because Linsey and Alison keep callin' 911. Now you reaping the storm. Beefin, no keepin the calm. Black people sweeping the city street. And seeking reform, pressing politicians. Hoping they redesign those frames. What's the point of tearing a statue down?. If minds don't change?. What's our limit?. This been happening in Houston for a minute. We never prevented until we get solution oriented. So it's back to protesting. Sir, please let us live we begging them not to take. A life they didn't give. In these serious position. We live and vote is frivolous. You think this country can handle another 4 years of this. (Hell nah). Divine judgment comin' down real hard. Black folks don't matter to you. But they matter to God.
