T.E.C.H.N.I.N.E. This motherfucker look like Wayne Brady. Nigga you's a bitch!. What you gon' say? "Oh, Gotti went to jail for a month, how'd he get out so quick?". Nigga, if that's ya angle, you better dump that shit. Paper work, public info, you can go to the court and run my shit. The only thing I'm tellin'...is ya mama how to suck my dick. This nigga pussy, the respect gon'. The chopper have ya neck gon'. I stopped watchin' Champion, cause a Rest In Peace shirt the only thing I'm tryin' to see Tech on. You dead wrong, claimin' that you one of the greats. I'll put a gun in ya face, extendo. Clear 30, this ain't up for debate. You know what I hate?. Old ass niggas like you livin' off ya past battles. When your resume full of trash battles. Every round is jokes and more jokes. Niggas be watchin', just waitin' to see a punch like Math battles. I'm goin' hard all year I can't take it easy on these haters. Head shot, when he wake up all he remember was, "You have what it takes. You can make it. You in the world's most respec-". The doctor's be soundin' like Beasley on the trailers. These niggas is fakers. I was known for Crippin' way befo' I was known for rappin'. So keep calm befo' it's ya dome I'm tappin'. Think R Streetz, if I pull it out, little nigga fo' sho' I'm clappin'. BAOW, Top, left of you hangin' on stage...real niggas know what happened. You don't rap like that, nigga fo' sho' I'm clappin'. Fuck a Tech 9, in battle rap you gon' stay wack. In the streets we use Rugers and Glocks. The only nigga usin' a Tec-9? JayBlac. Nigga straight facts. I stay strapped, bullets flyin', nigga you the victim. You gon' have to get Tech support; the computer trippin'. You a stupid nigga. You said I reuse bars, you know how stupid you sound?. Matter of fact, this the same can' I killed Ave wit'. BAOW, now that's how you recycle a round. Bitch you's a clown and ya mom's a silly ho. I'll fuck her in front of the microwave on camera, and let JayBlac do a reaction video. I'm disrespectful, I hope your baby mama get breast cancer while your baby gettin' breastfed. Before yo' granny die, I wanna be the nigga to pull up and take a piss on her deathbed. This nigga Tech dead, nigga you in my buildin', you can really lose ya life in. I hope you strapped, just know I got mines in. I'll kill you and that faggot ass light skinned hype man. And aim that shit at Smack like, "Nigga is you good? Well aight then.". I'm on one, kill mode just gotta make sure there ain't no witness lookin'. Cause I ain't tryin' to get caught, end up in that central booking. So I'm sneakin' with the biscuit, like my granny told me I couldn't eat til she finished cookin'. This nigga wussin', I don't listen when Tech speak. You lookin' at a pure shooter, just peep the technique. I can go over the top like a dramatic bitch or pull it behind ya back on some scandalous shit. Goddamn I'm sick. I'll let the .40 blam this bitch. I ain't never pressed for these weak hoes. Nina wit' me, I was lettin' mil's (Mill's) off befo' they freed Meek though. The heat low, the gun look fake but it ain't. Silly nigga, code word: Nicki Minaj. (What that mean?!). This bitch plastic but(t) it'll drop a Philly nigga. Really nigga, I'm a street nigga, you the rapper. I'll shake ya hand before the battle then shoot him after. Ruger clapper. Stand over the body and put three in his face. Y'all gon' see this bitch get dumped over Tech (texts) like, "I think I just need some space.". You can plead ya case but I'ma keep shootin' G. This muhfucka fully automatic so I can let this bitch off easy. Like, "Baby it's not you it's me.". Who is he? It don't matter they all look the same after the trigger squeeze. We got nine's, .44's, and .45's, I'm puttin' everything on Tech like my Twitter feed. And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes. Go 'head see if you can make them niggas believe them lies. Nigga time. [Round 1: Tech 9]. Can you hear me? Well aight then. You good ? Well aight then. They don' brought a nigga all the way from the east coast to battle a nigga on the west coast. And he's dope. I'm thinkin' Snoop, Dre, Chronic album, nothin' but weed smoke. Game, Nipsey, Kendrick, Eazy-E. Low riders, D.O.C., loc. Instead they got me battlin' Ray Swag and we all know that he choke. Bitch cut all this tough talk, don't be the one mark. He said, "I'm so used to the shot I just gotta hear it and I can tell what it is by the gun spark.". Nigga you dumb smart. A west coast nigga with gun smarts. But ya son in school gettin' asked, "What's 2 + 2?" Fuck he in class puttin' up 1 fo'?. But then again that's 1 fo'. 14 shots to the body that's one fo'. I took the .44 off Hova now that got me with one fo'. Look at punk ass Geechi and his family with all these fem' gestures. Should I chin check him or bench press him?. Silencer over the silencer so you ain't gon' be able to call a shot all you gon' feel is the wind pressure. You on Twitter sayin' 9's known for jammin' tryin' to put the shame on niggas. Old school so when you said, "the 9's jam" I was like, "Yeah NBA Jam they bang on niggas.". Told y'all in 2012, Bill Collector, they bang on niggas. Reverse that to collect a bill I bang on. I wanna see you die in the worst way. Funeral, hearse 'play. After I kill you I can't stop, I kill ya family dirty on Thursday. Slit ya mother throat, drown your grandmother on her church day. Walk in ya kid's school and let it sing, I'm tryin' to celebrate they birthday. Two pistols, to keep 'em quiet I got two tennis balls on the end like a cripple I'm usin' a walker. If I don't slow it down or translate it, two racks, you tennis ball I don't do drive bys I'm usually the walker. And take it a step further, I'm tryin' to keep it non violent. But if granny keep hollerin' she gon' force the blunt force trauma and. Weapon of choice I'm usin' her walker. I can never die if you kill me it's Night King now I'm fused with The Walkers. I can't stand ya creep ass. Botox, fake bitch I see past ya cheap ass. Cocaine cartel I seek cash. Punchin' others faster than a Mayweather speed bag. D.A. rush in? I'm hidin' in the bathroom wall like Miguel Rodriguez. You on Twitter committing foul actions. I'll let the cal' blast him. If he don't die durin' the ambulance ride, then somethin' gon' go wrong at the hospital like a malpractice. Who gon' ride?. Turn this into a huntin' game, I pick you to die. Road kill, you jumped in front of that car that's deer suicide. Light the crib up, everybody in that bitch get crucified. The Uzi connected to a string, the string hangin' around my neck. I'm a Champion, we got a suit and tie. Niggas is pussy, online eatin' gangsta cookies. But soon as you try to take them to school they play hookie. I play the N.E.R.D.s this shit can get for real (Pharrell) if you push me. It force me to bring the A.R. in the building like a white boy that's bein' bullied. You good with words Gotti, I let a cap spray. Plus I can handle a Verb better than Pat Stay. O.B.C. how about I say I catch you early like a matinee?. No, I don't even hop out the car. I shoot through the window, bangin' the hand off the steering wheel like I'm havin' bad day. Shut the fuck up! Pull that lil' deuce deuce, go 'head buck up. You aimin' it wrong. A false move and ya luck up. I'm sick of you pussy ass niggas actin' tough tough. I'm from Philly, ain't no Bloods and Crips but the wrong jersey will get you fucked up. What is it? Gangsta gally? You the Cali king? They got your pictures on fliers?. I guess it's easy to be the Cali king when your only competition is Danny Myers. The sad part? You couldn't even handle Myers. Metal with the grip with the rubber on hand like a pair of pliers. Round one. You might also like[Round Two: Geechi Gotti]. Aye I apologize for the contract. He gotta rap too it ain't my fault. He gotta rap. . Serious question my nigga, this is somethin' I've been contemplatin'. Battle rap Mount Rushmore, how come you ain't never in that conversation?. But niggas be thinkin' about the greats like Mook, Lux, Ars', Hollow, how come they ain't never mention your name?. Cause you a bum, you couldn't cover them spots if you was-. Man you act would go to somethin'. If this was basketball you wouldn't be MJ, Kobe, Lebron or even Duncan. More like AC Green. (Why's that?). You really known for fuckin' nothin'. Stop fuckin' frontin', talkin' 'bout you the king of Philly. You ain't Gilly, you ain't AR Ave. You ain't Kaboom, you ain't Reed, you ain't Meek or Cass'. When niggas think about the top niggas in Philly ain't nobody gon' say yo' ass. And durin' this ass whoopin' ain't nobody gon' save yo' ass. You ain't had a hot bar ever, you lucky they even paid yo' ass. Pinocchio, this Geppetto, this the nigga that made yo' ass. We know you wasn't runnin' no trap, you barely gettin' money from rap. Talkin' 'bout, "I be bustin' those dope moves". Nigga you wouldn't be Fresh if it wasn't for Smack. Now here goes some facts. You all jokes, no bars. So as for substance, as the crowd can see it really ain't much. You perform good as a muhfucka, but you don't be talkin' 'bout shit, like you don't really say much. That's why it makes sense why ya name Tech 9 (N9ne), cause I can see the holes in ya makeup (make up). W-w-why you gotta rap like that?. Y-y-you should fuckin' chill. Til you get pistol whipped and forget ya shit, nigga now you gotta stutter for real. What the fuck is the deal?. I've been to jail and I've been to college. See both situations, only my mama put money on them books. So don't judge a book cause it ain't all what it seems. Cause I done know niggas who got shot and niggas with degrees. See I could've got life or I coulda been a lawyer. Bro, I swear to God I'm a criminal who actually played both sides of the fence. You wouldn't find a fairer con (Farrakhan). Ain't you a Muslim, right?. Ain't ya name Hakeem?. See you don't really want beef. I can give you plenty reasons why. Hakeem you should've never took this so who ever allowed you on (Olajuwon) see you die. Rockets shit, Nina out, small talk, I'm just poppin' shit. You see these Glocks and shit?. Extendos lookin' like moppin' sticks. On Compton Crip a head shot will have stitches laced to the top like boxin' kicks. [?] don't dap me nigga I'll pull up on a bitch who had you and get nasty wit' her. Meanin' I'll put a Tech 9 in ya mama and disappear, same way your daddy did. All you rap is filler, Jerry killed you and he wasn't even at his best nigga. Now you got Gotti, this ain't ya first time dyin' to a west (Wess) nigga. I stretch niggas, I done laid plenty to rest. This a new era, I don't give a fuck about any of the vets. Especially you, more known for ya talkin' then ya ballin', you Kenny "The Jet". Head shot after head shot, that's what I'm finna do. They gon' fine ya body laid out in the street after I'm done killin' you. Coroners ain't even want to pick cuz up, so Tech (texts) was left on scene like when a bitch ain't feelin' you. I'm from Nutty Blocc I don't give a fuck where your peoples from. I'm a Packer's fan so I really didn't a fuck when the Eagles won. I want all the smoke, nigga Cheech & Chong. I hope you got a strap cause in Cali, you better keep you one. I told Beasley I wanted a Math problem but he gave me this cheap old bum. So I'ma put this nine over 9 and see if it can equal one. Knock him down and stand over the body and let the tool squirt. Two shots, baow, baow, tell Mama Tech her baby dead yeah the truth hurts. Another shot, BA-...aw this bitch jammed. Oh well I didn't need the third round; I'm Tsu Surf. DNA: Bodybag. Goodz: Bodybag. That nigga Bill Collector put your body bag in a body bag. You done been killed a gang of times before you even met me. They done ran out of body bags, after this we just gon' put him in a Hefty. And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes. Your turn, see if you can make them niggas believe them lies. [Round 2: Tech 9]. So you really gon' shoot my mother while she warmin' up some peas and shit?. And y'all really believe that shit?. Bay Loc, the Compton Crip that be squeezin' shit. I got rights so it's best if I just plead the fifth. And say nothin', cause if I do I'ma squeeze the clip. You from Nutty Blocc. Me? I'm from the other block. Strapped down, dump and peel, that the nutty block. If we don't catch you on the first go round, we send another shot. Then spin another block. Gotti don't know where to run, I got a car comin' down and a car comin' up the block. He in the middle of the street, you hear another shot. My shooter send another shot. Heavy handed bartender, he get a double shot. Why you actin' gangsta Gotti? You ain't no fuckin' goon. He shot niggas, did he? Stop treatin' me like I'm fuckin' Lou'. We can do this the quiet way or the loud way, you hear the gun go BOOM. Pull the Desert out, the E's will drop him like he heard it from another room. I said you was a rappin' star, but you rap with your head down and the wolves will eat you for lunch. You got better but I'm not flattered, you ain't thank me enough. I came in L.A., motorcycle like, "Aye cuz where the fuck is the plug?". Parked on Crenshaw, then Gotti stole my bike, see he playin' too much. I said you rap with your head down, I wasn't tryin' to play you for chump. Well since Baby Boy wanna steal bikes, now he gotta rap with his head up while y'all wait for the punch. You shavin' dirt. I want my money back or your dame get murked. Or I can shoot her in the neck or the blade will work. If you played Captain Save A Hoe the stainless burst. Stab an ice pick in ya eye then rerun it across your face like it's my favorite shirt. That line was naaah, used that sloppy. Could I have used it a better way? Probably. Let me rewind that line back, copy. Gem star to your neck then rerun it across your face it look like I'm playin' air hockey. Streets Of Rage, I can hit him with the ax or he can meet the blade. Hunter with this thunder right now it's time to stop the microwave. Of course I love wrestling bars, I'll get you Rock'ed slam. Shawn Michaels with the kick, I got a hot hand. These Dudley Brothers, one lift you in the air and the other put you through a table. I'm a beast, married to that white girl, call her Sable. Bitch where, Roman Reigns you get your shit spared. North Carolina/Detroit, T-Top to Tee Grizzley, I brought a big bear. A new day for this Uso I'll let a clip air. Two AR's got me walkin' like Ric Flair. I came in this game filled with stars, I'm talkin' VCR's. The Chinese spot, everything we spit was raw. I've been in tough battles, my resume is built with scars. Gotti you ain't nothin' but a cash register so I treat you like a cashier and tuck one under like the bill too large. I'm back on Smack it's time for my Ascension. Ready for the bullshit so miss me with the detention. Layin' on a roof is the only time I'm crawlin' for position. You sell hair so you should be used to these extensions. Gotti I thought you was a real one. You said you had six months to a year in jail and you came home in two weeks. Sheesh. I don't know what type of deal you cut, man that shit was sweet. They confronted you with jail time unless you turned informant, made you squeak. Southside Compton Crip huh?. No wonder they got you out here tellin' on the nephews like [?]. I'll put 18 through your wheel, the dawgs on it. You hop out and try to run, I'm all on it. Catch him at the end of the trailer and then I pull it. {Beasley voice} Although we do this for sport, it is not a game. He got hit with a Beasley bullet. Call it quits. If I make change it's for the Parliament. I got .40 cents in my hand and I'm spendin' all of it. I want your baby mother, I heard she was a baller bitch. So I can stuff her in a black trash bag, that's how you ball a bitch. You'se a Beverly Hills rapper. Ain't no murders down there. You keep your doors locked for what? Ain't no burglars down there. Come to Philly, you fuck around and get murdered down there. Talkin' beef, turn his body to burger down there. Talk is cheap, we take it a step further down there. Not Geechi man but Gucci Man, the clip go blllet blllet burn down there. You bird nigga. Round 2. . [Round 3: Geechi Gotti]. Aye this nigga got his mans right here tellin' you the words the whole time and shit. {laughs}. And then you rap for like ten minutes wastin' niggas time and shit. Tryin' to play me for a snitch, man that shit wack. In Cali them type of accusations will get you bitch slapped. Real rap, but I heard Tech a legend. I say, "A legend for what? Cause he beat Miles?". Nigga what that mean to a nigga that beat trials?. Free my nigga Doggy and Baby Wood, my bros on that fo' yard. Say they livin' through me, so I ain't got no choice but to go hard. See I coulda been killed, if it wasn't for rappin'. Still duckin' them shots from guns that's clappin'. They say my life like a movie. I say this shit couldn't be comedy cause I wasn't laughin'. And when them niggas came through shootin' clips and my patnas died on the scene, that wasn't actin'. Y'all remember Boyz N The Hood?. Ice Cube played Doughboy, that movie made him a star. But we in land of the gangbang, walk ups and drive bys. That wasn't the first time I seen a nigga let the tre (Trey) out the car. True story, I hate it when they say cause we grew up in the hood we hopeless. Nigga that's a damn lie cause I remember goin' to school and my teachers used to be like, You can be whatever you want, you don't gotta be this thug guy.". I said, "I know. I believe anything is possible. Shit yesterday I seen some slugs fly.". Now listen, When Doves Cry, see growin' up, that song ain't make a lot of sense. Til my patna got cracked for a murder cause he ain't had gloves on That's when I realized you can actually learn a lot from prints (Prince). Now I've been pissed, off for a minute. Cause y'all remember I asked a mama what hurt more; givin' birth or buryin' him?. She told me it was givin' birth, now that answer threw me to the left. She said cause she never planned on bein' pregnant but the way that nigga was livin' she was already plannin' for his death. Now this lifestyle will have a nigga stressed. Like the condom broke in a hoodrat. My biggest fear, is gettin' smoked by a nigga who was just askin' where the woods at. True story, that's why I'm never slippin', it's forever grippin'. Two straps, one nine, one revolver, the code word: Red Lobster. (What the fuck that mean?). You will get this before the meal, it's a cheddar biscuit. The Metal Twisted, but it's not a game. I hold it like this cause I don't need the aim. BAOW, put this clown head on fire he Needles Kane. The heat'll bang, they told me, if they ain't ridin' for you, then what the fuck you doin' wit' 'em?. I sent a prayer up to Spittage, he told me to tell you stop sayin' his name before the battles if you gon' be losin' in 'em. Stupid nigga. My cousin Wicked got hit when that Tec jammed; true story. I'm just glad he live to tell about it. My patna got shot in his couch, left stankin' in the house. I seen his grandma she said she still can't get the smell up out it. You gotta have the stomach for this. I digress cause seein' my niggas just die, that's hard to digest. But I guess, we done been to enough jails. Even blindfolded we can sketch out the cell pattern. This the gangland where niggas die, rags cover the coughin' (coffin) like we well mannered. My niggas hit me everyday like, "Gotti what's up? I'm glad you got out.". Cause I'm one of the few niggas that understand a green dot is more important than a shoot out. My niggas be in there pissed off, thinkin' that niggas don't give a fuck about him like they must hate 'em. It be everyday I be gettin' frustrated wishin' I could just save 'em. Cause they write letters to niggas who won't even write back. The only letter they get is the one the judge gave 'em. And you think I gave a fuck about who they cheer fo'?. I only came here to show the difference between a real one and a weirdo. And when it's real you can see it in they eyes. Go 'head see if you can make them believe them lies. Time. . [Round 3: Tech 9]. Can y'all hear me? Well aight then. You good? Well aight then. S.P.I.T.T.A.G.E. Y'all motherfuckers get it right Wayne A.V.E. Look at my eyes, you see nothin' but pain inside. I done lost love ones, close friends, they talkin' change. Well in my city ain't nothin' in mine. Over a quarter you can catch a quarter, I got a little change in mind. These young boys on a suicide mission cause they was trained to ride. Innocent bystanders gettin' shot cause these pussies aimin' high. When it's hot the murder rate pop. When it's cold the murder rate drop, it's crazy how the weather can be the reason whether you live or die. Gotti you can't talk this real shit to me, everything you claim you did I've been through it. My little sister was murdered on the corner of my mother's block, now every time she walk home from work she gotta live through it. If you don't get killed by your own brother then the pigs do it. Stop snitchin', these little niggas get a story and they stick to it. I got so many guns sometimes I don't know how to pick 'em. First it's the TEC, warning shots so I rip low. Second is the 4-5, the feelin' make me wanna grip mo'. The third is the AR the shit got me walkin' like my hip broke. I can't figure out what gun I wanna smoke you with but don't trip though. Cause you can get 'em all, you can get the 1, 2 and the 3 like Avocado intro. . {Chokes}. . You look like one of them old ass hip hop fans, that knows the words to every song. Y'all know that friend that know the first verse before it comes on?. Regulator!. It was a clear black night, a clear white moon. Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume. Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk. Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone. Just hit the east side of the LBC. On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G. Seen a car full of skirts, ain't no need to tweak. All you skirts know what's up with 213. Mount up. Nigga how you rap the first verse before the mount up. Some of the shit you do just don't mount up. Crib like a gun store, AK and AR's on the wall I got the mount up. Trap house movin' dope sales. Security on lock don't get your throat melt. Come to my crib with all that vendin'. And it's a machine on every floor like it's a hotel. Personals, why I gotta dig dirt. If I dig dirt it's followed by a casket, big hearse. What L.A. did to Notorious, I should strangle you with a big shirt. [?] and I got somethin' and common. She 4'5" and I got the 4-5, we both tryin' to wig first. URL sponsored by the smoke. Somebody call Al Kapone cause Gotti catchin' the cig' (Sig') first. Champion, we treat battle rap like it's a sport too. Extension, drive-by on the court too. Cheap money, big talk and you can't afford to. Game Of Thrones, my gun don't got a body but my sword do. Blades shiftin', Valerian steel, they made different. You talk at her, I talk to her, the age different. Lanes switchin', usin' 2-20 on the dash we race different. I land on the roof top of the hotel, you pull up with a roof top to the hotel we stay different. Breast milk baby, Similac bay, we raised different. You shakin' with the gun, I'm steady with the gun we raise different. Nigga owe you money you give them deadlines, extension. A nigga owe me money it's a dead line, extension. Cold killer, oh you a drama starter. I catch you at the crib playin' bones witcha girl. Knife out, put stake in ya company then turn around and hit you with the silent partner. Quiet investor, detective found stake in your company but couldn't find out where money came from cause I hit you with the silent, partner1Embed
