I'm on my own, broke and alone. I feel the rain crashing down. All around this empty town. I'm searching for the lost and found. But you don't care, you're unaware. Keep moving like the scars aren't even there. It's in the air, like a prism flare. Just stay cause the flames will burn us. . [Chorus]. I thought you were the one for me. That's why I gave you everything. Held you close by the stormy seas. Oh, you meant the world to me. [Pre-Drop]. I used to kiss your head when you cried for me. Hold your hand while the pain was all around. Keep you warmed by the roaring sea. Oh, you meant the world to me. . [Drop]. Oh, you meant the world to me. Oh, you meant the world to me. . [Verse 2]. My darling dear, you're never here. When I'm in pain you hide and disappear. Like shadows in the atmosphere. Charming the stratosphere, yeah. I prayed for you, and catch you near. In hopes you'd chase away my fears. I'm on my own, you made it so. And now I'm chasing nightmares through your pain. . [Pre-Chorus]. I used to run with you through the great big leaves. Laugh at you when you laugh at me. Hope for us because I believed. That home was just you and me. You might also like[Chorus]. I thought you were the one for me. That's why I gave you everything. Held you close by the stormy seas. Oh, you meant the world to me. . [Drop]. Oh, you meant the world to me. Oh, you meant the world to me. . [Bridge]. Oh, I'm gonna do this on my own. No point in blaming you, you did not know, oh. . [Chorus]. I thought you were the one for me. That's why I gave you everything. Held you close by the stormy seas. Oh, you meant the world to me. . [Drop]. Oh, you meant the world to me. Oh, you meant the world to me. . [Bridge]. Oh, I'm gonna do this on my own. No point in blaming you, you did not know, oh. Oh, I'm gonna do this on my own. No point in blaming you, you did not know, oh. [Chorus]. I thought you were the one for me. That's why I gave you everything. Held you close by the stormy seas. Oh, you meant the world to me6Embed
