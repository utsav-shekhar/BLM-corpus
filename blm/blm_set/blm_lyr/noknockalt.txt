Um, we want to do a poem for one of our unfavorite people, um, who’s now the head of the, uh, Nixon campaign.  He was formerly the Attorney General named John Mitchell.  Um, Nixon’s campaign seems to be out, you know, getting off on a rather hip foot after his trip to China in the name of peace, uh, while they were killing people right across the street, so to speak, in, uh, North and South Vietnam.  But, um, no-knock, the law in particular, was allegedly, um, aheh, legislated for black people rather than, you know, for their destruction.  And it means, simply, that authorities and members of the police force no longer have to knock on your door before entering.  They can now knock your door down. This is No Knock. . . [Verse 1]. You explained it to me, I must admit. But just for the record, you were talking shit. Long rap about no-knock being legislated. For the people you've always hated. In this hellhole that you, we, call home. . [Verse 2]. No-knock, the man will say. To keep that man from beating his wife. No-knock, the man will say. To protect people from themselves. [Chorus]. No-knocking, head-rocking. Enter, shocking, shooting, cussing. Killing, crying, lying, and. Being white. No-knock. . [Verse 3]. No-knocked on my brother Fred Hampton. Bullet holes all over the place. No-knocked on my brother Michael Harris. And jammed a shotgun against his skull. . [Verse 4]. For my protection?. Who's gonna protect me from you?. The likes of you?. The nerve of you?. To talk that shit face-to-face. Your tomato face deadpan. Your deadpan deadening another freedom plan. . [Chorus]. No-knocking, head-rocking. Enter, shocking, shooting, cussing. Killing, crying, lying, and. Being white. You might also like[Verse 5]. But if you're wise, no-knocker. You'll tell your no-knocking lackeys—ha!. No-knock on my brothers’ heads. No-knock on my sisters’ heads. No-knock on my brothers’ heads. No-knock on my sisters’ heads. . [Verse 6]. And double-lock your door. Because, soon, someone may be no-knocking—ha, ha!. For you. . [Outro]. No Knock.  To be slipped into John Mitchell’s suggestion box. 1Embed
