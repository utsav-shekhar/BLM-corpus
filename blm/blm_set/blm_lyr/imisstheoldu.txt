I miss the old you. The one that held me down and kinda told the truth. At Warwick every Wednesday. Can't control you. Partyin' with rappers. Actin' hoeish too. You got yourself a singer, ah. . [Pre-Chorus]. When it was on, we was on fire. Even let you and your girls go whip the Ghost 'round town. Draped you head to toe in GucciGhost, wow. And I never got a single fuckin' thank you from you. Or, "I love you daddy". You ungrateful bitch. The more the baddie, more the bratty. Man, I take you out for dinners. Take you shopping for them clothes. Before I got so distant. And you got so fucking cold. [Chorus]. I miss the old you. I miss the old you. I used to hold you. I used to hold you. And that ain't cost nothing, baby. Real love don't cost a motherfuckin' penny. I miss the old me. I miss the way I used to be. I miss the old me. And now these drugs controllin' me. It's all your fault, baby. Still reaching for that Henny. . [Post-Chorus]. And I never got a single fuckin' thank you from you. Or, "I love you daddy". You ungrateful bitch. The more the baddie, more the bratty. Man, I take you out for dinners. Take you shopping for them clothes. Before I got so rich and couldn't trust none of these hoes. I miss the old you.

Started bumping 21 and NAV. Just 'cause we do. On the slow notes, late night. Beartrap, mansionz. I got snoozegod on my right. I pour a four up in my Sprite. . [Pre-Chorus]. When it was on, we was on fire. Even let you and your girls go whip the Ghost 'round town. Draped you head to toe in Gucci Ghost, wow. And I never got a single fucking thank you from you.
