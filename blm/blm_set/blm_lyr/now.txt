Don't try to take this from me. Don't try to take this from me. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. Don't try to take this from me. Don't try to take this from me. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. . [Verse 1]. Feels like I'm waking from the dead. And everyone's been waiting on me. 'Least now I'll never have to wonder. What it's like to sleep a year away. But weren't we indestructible?. I thought that we could brave it all. I never thought that what would take me out. Was hiding down below. [Pre-Chorus]. Lost the battle, win the war. I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore. Starting over or head back in. There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it. . [Chorus]. If there's a future, we want it. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. If there's a future, we want it. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. If there's a future, we want it. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. If there's a future, we want it. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. . [Post-Chorus]. Don't try to take this from me. Don't try to take this from me. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. Don't try to take this from me. Don't try to take this from me. Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow. . [Verse 2]. Wish I could find a crystal ball. For the days I feel completely worthless. You know I'd use it all for good. I would not take it for granted. Instead, I have some memories. For the days I don't feel anything. At the least, they will remind me. Not to make the same mistakes again. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. Lost the battle, win the war. I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore.
