. [Intro]. Aminor. Welcome to my show!. . [Verse 1]. Welcome to my show. Let your fam know Let your friends know. I’m hotter than Fresno. It’s lit in my crib tonight let your eyes glow. I clock out as Clark Kent. I clock back in as Superman. Your favorite Superhero. Name is Aminor, this is my king flow. Let the King Flow, Adios to your career. After these Audios My bad!. Amigo, I need to pipe down. Hook me up Mario!. Yo no habla Spanish, but I trabajo solo. That means I’m on my own I learned that from El Chapo. I’m chopping these words down. Like I’m Arnold while she getting down. I’m screaming. Get to Tha Choppa!. Roll up Pair of Dice. Lost in a Paradise. Analyze with my eyes like butterflies in the Skies. Tired of disgusting lies. Sell it for a cheaper price. I’m cold like pair of ice, sorry I can’t be nice. I can’t relax Racks on Racks. Challenge Rocky to a boxing match. Rocking Jason’s hockey mask. High class, Remi Martin glass. Above the crowds Above the Roads. Above the clouds no sound. It’s way too early many more rounds left. I’m a modern day Davinci. Legend of Odyssey. Somebody avenge me. I’m diving into the sea. Senpai notice me, there’s so much more to see. I just learned my ABCs, Look! (1, 2, 3). Life isn’t as easy as I thought it would be. I just wanna be rich like Jay Z. Get a wife like Queen B. A daughter like Ivy. Honestly I hate it when people take me too seriously. My life is a comedy movie ever since I left Turkey. Everything turned gravy. I started drinking Hennessey with John F. Kennedy. Playing tennis with Serena Williams in Tennessee. Life doesn’t go the way you want it to be. That reminds me, my mom wants me to be a doctor. Now look at me, terrorizing the Rap game. You can call me Vanilla Ice’s Baby oh baby. I tried to behave but nobody can tame me. [Outro]. God opened the doors for me he gave me. Freedom to explore, something I’ve never done before. I scream Thanks Lord. And he said and he said and he said. You're welcome Boy!You might also likeEmbed
