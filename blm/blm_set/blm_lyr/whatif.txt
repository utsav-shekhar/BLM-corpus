What if Martin didn't stand up?. What if Rosa didn’t sit down?. What if Malcolm didn't man up?. Where would we be now?. What if Marley didn't get up, stand up?. What if Du Bois didn’t come to advance us?. And Mandela didn't come to teach us?. Where would we be now?. . [Pre-Chorus]. We are the ones we've been waitin' for. We can change the world. We can change the world. [Chorus]. With our love, love, love, love. Love, love, love, love. 'Cause it is up to us.... We are the ones we've been waitin' for. We can change the world. Our love can change the world. We can change the world. With our love, love, love, love. Love, love, love, love. Our love can change the world. . [Verse 2]. What if Maya didn't speak out?. What if Langston Hughes didn’t write it down?. What if Josephine Baker didn’t dance it out? (No). Tell me where would we be now?. What if Sojourner never told the truth?. Ida B. Wells never printed the news?. Harriet never went underground?. Where would we be now?. . [Pre-Chorus]. We are the ones we've been waitin’ for. We can change the world. We can change the world.

Together we are love. Me too, I matter, you matter, we matter. Together we are love. It’s gotta be all of us. Stand up and speak up. With all of our love. . [Chorus]. Love, love, love, love. Love, love, love, love. 'Cause it is up to us.... We are the ones we've been waitin' for. We can change the world. Our love'll change the world. We will change the world.
