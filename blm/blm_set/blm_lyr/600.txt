There's no difference between you and I. We share the same sunshine from the same sky. When it rains, it rains on both you and I. Gotta sink or swim, now it's do or die. . [Pre-Chorus]. It goes hashtag, bodybag. Toe tag. Shot in the chest. Hashtag bodybag. Even when I'm on my last breath. [Chorus]. 'Til we get reciprocity. How can we stand by?. Yesterday, I turned on the TV. I saw another man down. He was screaming. He can't breathe no more. He held his hands high. But then he got struck down. Oh, he got struck down. . [Drop]. I saw the body drop. On the six o'clock. I saw the body drop. On the six o'clock. Struck down, struck down. . [Verse 2]. There's no difference between you and I. Same space in time that we occupy. We all just looking for a piece of the pie. We went blind, going eye for an eye. . [Pre-Chorus]. It goes hashtag, bodybag. Toe tag. Shot in the chest. Hashtag bodybag. Even when I'm on my last breath. You might also like[Chorus].

Oh, he got struck down. . [Drop]. I saw the body drop. On the six o'clock. I saw the body drop. On the six o'clock. Struck down, struck down. . [Bridge]. I won't give no fucks. I won't take no shit. Try to burn me down. Get this whole place lit. I won't give no fucks. I won't take no shit. They said they want war, this is it. [Drop]. Let the body drop. Then let the body drop. Then let the body drop. Then let the body drop16Embed
