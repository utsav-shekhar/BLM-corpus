Hands up!. . [Verse 1: Tyler Carter]. Easily temperamental, dangerously equipped. Impossibly avoidable by proving their contempt. Bastardizing the justice and living above the law. Black and blue don't get along, blue just want 'em dead and gone. . [Chorus: Michael Bohn]. Empty your clips on the victim. And then you look the other way. Your nation will crumble. And you'll just look the other way. [Verse 2: Tyler Carter & Michael Bohn]. Got a hood rat and the alley cat heard. The city got a kid hesitating to leave work. At the right time in the wrong place got served. An extendo, not a miranda head first. Get down, already knocked out face on the ground. We're at war with the ones who protect and serve. . [Chorus: Michael Bohn & Tyler Carter]. Empty your clips on the victim. And then you look the other way. Minorities perish. And even though he got his hands up. . [Bridge: Michael Bohn]. Caged like animals. Wound up and released with their badges. Brutalize our streets, savages. How many have to die. To put an end to crooked swine?. . [Chorus: AJ Rebollo]. And you just look the other way. Empty your clips on the victim. And then you look the other way. Your nation will crumble. And you just look the other way. You might also like[Outro: Michael Bohn].
