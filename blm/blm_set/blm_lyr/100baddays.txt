Remember when we all got drunk?. I ended up with two broke thumbs. Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me. I wrote a song that no one knows. I played a show and no one showed. Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me. . [Pre-Chorus]. (Ah) When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell. (Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?. [Chorus]. Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories. A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties. A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories. A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah. No, I ain't scared of you. No, I ain't scared of you no more. . [Post-Chorus]. La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da. La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da. No, I ain't scared of you. No, I ain't scared of you no more. . [Verse 2]. Remember when she broke my heart. Waitin' for the waiter to return my card?. Right as I let down my guard, lucky me. We had to work a bit more hard. Only just to get a little bit less far. We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we?. . [Pre-Chorus].
