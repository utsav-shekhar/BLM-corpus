Better get your money up. [Verse 1]. He's trying to run. H's trying to run to outrun a gun. He's gone full Ye. And he's starting to feel that shit might pop off. . The police man said he'd been a fan. As he slapped the cuffs onto my wrist. The security did not fuck around. When they bounced my black ass from the club. . [Verse 2]. So I will defy. I will defy and I will destroy. I will denounce. Shave my head to a number 1. . The airport feeding me a line. As they check all through my carry on. The shop clerk doesn't make a sound. As she watches me on CCTV. . [Verse 3]. I came in all black. I came in all black to dead that. I'm cutting you off child. I'm cutting you off, fact.

So quit it with the coonery. The japes and the tomfoolery. Shucking and jiving in your video. Like no one was gonna know. . You're fucking with a legacy. That's bigger than him and that's bigger than me. From the playground gates to your estate. To the money I make. . You go home to your house in Calabasas. And your wife and your kids safe in the knowledge. On a gated street where life is sweet. But no one looks like you. . Why won't they let our children kick it?. It's the signs of the father's sin still sticking. If you play your cards right, I could put you on a flight. Homeboy's gonna get it, oh yeah. [Chorus]. Like cocoa from the Congo. Like gold from Senegal. Better get yourself together. Better get your money up. . Like cocoa from the Congo. Like gold from Senegal. Better get yourself together. Better get your money up. Better get your money up. Better get your money up. . [Verse 4]. So I will invest, I will invent. And I will inform. I will buy land. I will put food in the children's mouths. . When I look in the mirror. I like what I see. I don't come for drama but it finds me. Turned half a mil to a 1.5. Your don't need to hold your purse so tight. . See I believe in Karma. So I pay my bills on time. Are you going to give me trouble?. I've heard about your kind. I keep my shit exclusive. I keep my circle tight. And if you front. I will drop you where you stand. .
