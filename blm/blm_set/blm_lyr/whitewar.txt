"We have never really seen the war go away. I mean. If you're dying. If you're dying from the 7th cavalry's bullets. If you're dying from induced poverty and racism and class systems and sex systems. And you're dying from alcoholism and poverty. Or someone has come in now in the name of maximizing the profit. And they're getting you to work in the mines, the uranium mines. And you're dying from lung cancer and you're dying from the cancers and the diseases that come out of that. You're dying. It's the same as the bullet killing you. And I see it all as a war". ---. On dusted plains. Songs that my people sing. Make me feel like I ain't gotta worry bout a thing. The ballad swings. Everyone treated like a king. Remember mother earth. And the teachings that she brings. . But why I'm back. You'll find that. It's all related. It reminds that with purpose we're all created. But that's debated. Distorted by those who hated. On our beliefs. Cause we believed all things were sacred. . The long-awaited. Seventh generation feels. The pain. Uranium drain from our black hills. Let it rain. Genocide won't pay the bills. I feel the shame. Suicidal thoughts give me chills. You might also likeI can't escape that warming up with this smallpox blanket. While I see my mother get abused. I'm accused. Of a rebel. Cause I don't dance with the devil. I got these. Reservation blues. . CHORUS. . I bet their hearts drop when they hear these drums. And hear our songs now. Tired of being oppressed. We're standing strong now. You can't white wash me in this white war. You can't speak about people you don't fight for. . Their hearts drop when they hear these drums. And hear our songs now. Tired of being oppressed. We're standing strong now. You can't white wash me in this white war. You can't speak about people you don't fight for. . I'm a product. Of chaotic love. Planted in psychotic mud. A rose from rosebud. Who rose from haunted clubs. Hooked on phonics. Beating on my sonic drum. Addicted to my demons. And my melancholic drug. Self-hate on my sleeve. Self-destruction on my mind. Alone in this house I built with my beats constructed rhymes. I'm not allowed to leave. Until I deconstruct my mind. Historical trauma. Got my spirit stuck in time. . Manifest destiny. Arrested all that is left for me. I used to be free in this land. But now I'm a refugee. In the name of progress. Presidents ordered the death of me. Shout out Lakota 38. I pray that you're blessing me. . Resistance is natural. Ancestral energy. God has the survival. Decolonized memories. Apologies will never make amends for your colonies. America, you a bitch. Give us our sovereignty. . [Chorus]. . I bet their hearts drop when they hear these drums. And hear our songs now. Tired of being oppressed. We're standing strong now. You can't white wash me in this white war. You can't speak about people you don't fight for. . Their hearts drop when they hear these drums. And hear our songs now. Tired of being oppressed. We're standing strong now. You can't white wash me in this white war. You can't speak about people you don't fight for. . They say these wars never ended. Descended from the spirit. Singing songs of freedom. Our ghosts make you hear it. . Genocide never ended. Descended from the spirit. Singing songs of truth. Their lives make you fear it. . Way of life never ended. Descended from the spirit. Singing songs of freedom. Our ghosts make you hear it. . Revolution never ended. Descended from the spirit. Singing songs of hope. Hoping my people hear it. . [john trudell sample]. "and in order for that system to work. They have to mine our minds. To get at the essence of our spirit. The mining of the essence. The mining of the spirit. Mining our minds. The pollution from that. Is all of the neurotic, distorted, insecure behavior patterns that we develop. That's the pollution. But it's a disease. Lives and travels through the mind. Through the generations"Embed
