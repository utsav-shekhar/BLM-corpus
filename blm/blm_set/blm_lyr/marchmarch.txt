March, march to my own drum. March, march to my own drum. Hey, hey, I'm an army of one. Oh, I'm an army of one. March, march to my own drum. March, march to my own drum. Hey, hey, I'm an army of one. Oh, I'm an army of one. . [Verse 1]. Brenda's packin' heat 'cause she don't like Mondays. Underpaid teacher policin' the hallways. Print yourself a weapon and take it to the gun range. (Ah, cut the shit, you ain't goin' to the gun range). Standin' with Emma and our sons and daughters. Watchin' our youth have to solve our problems. I'll follow them, so who's comin' with me?. (Half of you love me, half already hate me). [Chorus]. March, march to my own drum. March, march to my own drum. Hey, hey, I'm an army of one. Oh, I'm an army of one. March, march to my own drum. March, march to my own drum. Hey, hey, I'm an army of one. Oh, I'm an army of one. . [Verse 2]. Tell the ol' boys in the white bread lobby. What they can and can't do with their bodies. Temperatures are risin', cities are sinkin'. (Ah, cut the shit, you know your city is sinkin'). Lies are truth and truth is fiction. Everybody's talkin', who's gonna listen?. What the hell happened in Helsinki?. . [Chorus]. March, march to my own drum. March, march to my own drum. Hey, hey, I'm an army of one. Oh, I'm an army of one. March, march to my own drum. March, march to my own drum. Hey, hey, I'm an army of one. Oh, I'm an army of one. You might also like[Instrumental Outro]2Embed
