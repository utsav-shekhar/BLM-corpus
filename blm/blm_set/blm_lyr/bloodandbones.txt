Blood and bones are what we're made of. Not enough steel to reconcile. Crying out into the darkness. One sure way to feel alive. Demon mouths lined with halos. Thinly veiled, but no surprise. Rest assured, a welcomed surplus. Of systematic lies. . This child ain't mine but my hands are tied. She's a life of bounty, and her skin is white. Under my care she'll play and thrive. In a few years, I'll be cast aside. I was once a noble daughter. Our kingdom spanned the breadth of Ghana. But I was captured for the silver. Sent across the sea to a land unknown. . Our rival sold me to some white men. Skin as though it came from heaven. When they bound us to their will. They trapped themselves in hell as well. . [Chorus]. Blood and bones are what we're made of. Not enough steel to reconcile. Crying out into the darkness. One sure way to feel alive. Demon mouths lined with halos. Thinly veiled, but no surprise. Rest assured, a welcomed surplus. Of systematic lies. . One brother white, the other black. One brother loved and the other's [trash?]. One brother kept, the other sold. Kinship denied is kinship still. . Bred in bone and bathed in blood. Two brothers begged for light and love. White father twisting his own soul. To deny what all must know. You might also like[Chorus]. Blood and bones are what we're made of. Not enough steel to reconcile. Crying out into the darkness. One sure way to feel alive. Demon mouths lined with halos. Thinly veiled, but no surprise. Rest assured, a welcomed surplus. Of systematic lies. . [Chorus]. Blood and bones are what we're made of. Not enough steel to reconcile. Crying out into the darkness. One sure way to feel alive. Demon mouths lined with halos. Thinly veiled, but no surprise. Rest assured, a welcomed surplus. Of systematic lies2Embed
