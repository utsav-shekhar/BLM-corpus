I know they don't like me that much. Guess that I don't dress how they want. I just wanna be myself. I can't be someone else. Try to color inside their lines. Try to live a life by design. I just wanna be myself. I can't be someone else, someone else. . [Pre-Chorus]. They yell, they preach, I've heard it all before. "Be this, be that", I've heard it before, heard it before. [Chorus]. Big boys don't cry. Shoot low, aim high. Eat up, stay thin. Stand out, fit in. Good girls don't fight. Be you, dress right. White face, tan skin. Stand out, fit in. . [Post-Chorus]. Stand out, fit in. Stand out, fit in. . [Verse 2]. Lately, it's been too much all day. Words shot like a cannon at me. I just wanna be myself. I can't be someone else, someone else. . [Pre-Chorus]. They yell, they preach, I've heard it all before. "Be this, be that", I've heard it before, heard it before. . [Chorus]. Big boys don't cry. Shoot low, aim high. Eat up, stay thin. Stand out, fit in. Good girls don't fight. Be you, dress right. White face, tan skin. Stand out, fit in. You might also like[Post-Chorus]. Stand out fit in. Stand out fit in. Stand out fit in. Stand out fit in. .

Good girls don't fight. Be you, dress right. White face, tan skin. Stand out, fit in (Oh). Big boys don't cry. Shoot low, aim high. Eat up, stay thin. Stand out, fit in (Oh). Good girls don't fight.
