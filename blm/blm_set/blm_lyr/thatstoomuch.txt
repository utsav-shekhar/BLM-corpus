Yeah, big Fris. Yeah yeah. Oi, you're doing too much out here. Way too much. You just got take it easy, I dunno what all the fuss is about. Ha ha. Raskit. Trus'. Frisco, D Double. Hey. [Chorus: Dizzee Rascal]. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuff. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuff. . [Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]. Got a lotta bottle, look at him he's coddled. Midnight black V12, got my black airmax putting pressure on the throttle. Far from subtle. Whole lot of fuss and kerfuffle. Me, I just skate, I don't scuttle. Move like a red hot knife through butter I don't want no debates, spare me the rebuttal. One punch knuckle, moon in the place, no balloon in my face. Rudeboi, I don't shuffle. Wish I would've learnt 'cause it looks like fun but I really gotta hustle. Got a bit of fat hanging off a lot of muscle. Love a bit of mussel with a white wine sauce in a bit of tagliatelle with a little bit of truffle. Don't get your feathers in a ruffle. I remember I was in the manor with my second hand garms and my creps all scuffled. Now I'm fresher. Stay firm, don't break under pressure. Test me and I turn the aggressor. And I'm straight down the line, no messer. Peng tings sittin' at the dresser. She's peng and I wanna undress her. She just wants to be the one, god bless her. And I ain't gotta spend a whole lotta P to impress her. You might also like[Chorus: Dizzee Rascal and Frisco ]. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuff. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip (Fris) I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuff. . [Verse 2: Frisco]. Wait (hold on cuz). Say my name, that's carrying weight. Got no patience, I don't wanna wait. And I hate when the weed man makes man wait. Wait hold on cuz, you better chat to your donny. Can't diss man, I come tell man sorry. Get the wake-up call, no Phillip or Holly. 'Cuh I carry weight like a ten tonne lorry. It's mad on the road side. Haters are hating, I think that I know why. Man wanna chat but for that I got no time. Try know that it's showtime then home time, yeah. Them man over there still doing too much. We got so much hands in pies fam. How could we be losing touch?. It's all mad when I go on. Flow's so cold make a MC put his coat on. Man wanna violate, that's gonna go wrong. There's nobody in the world I told on, nah. 'Cuh where I come from we don't chat to police. You little foot fetish MCs taking Ls. Must have a taste for defeat. [Chorus: Dizzee Rascal]. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much.

Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuff. . [Verse 3: D Double E]. Bidibupup, it's me-me. I ain't gonna say too much but when I'm on a riddim I do too much. Me and Dizzee Rascal done too much. MCs try but they can't do much. Can't forget about Boy Better Know, about Frisco. Murk the houseparty and disco. Back in the day I was taking the piss. Always been at the top of the list. But I don't wanna hype too much on Insta. Nah, I don't like too much. Skrr, on the Kawasaki Ninja. But nowadays I don't ride too much. Hit him with a ratata, hit him with the bluck-bluck. I don't wanna fight too much. Never about, 'cause I fly too much. Can't remember, I spoke too much. I've been Amsterdam so many times. Certain man must think that I'm Dutch, gas. Accelerate on the clutch. Music scene, man keep in touch. First class, us man are on board. When I'm on a riddim, you never get bored. Don't know we got tucked away and stored. On point, razor sharp like sword, 'cuh. . [Chorus: Dizzee]. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuff. That's too much. I ain't gotta gas too much. Get cash, I don't flash too much. Get gash, I don't bash too much. 'Cause I lash too much. Big whip I don't crash too much. Quick dip and I dash too much. Two-fifth on a dash and stuffEmbed
