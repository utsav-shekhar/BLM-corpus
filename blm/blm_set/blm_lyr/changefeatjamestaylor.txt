One, two, three, four. Ooh, oh, yeah. . [Verse 1: Charlie Puth]. Why are we looking down. On our sisters and brothers?. Isn't love all that we got? Mmm. Don't we know everyone's. Got a father and mother?. The day we know we're all the same. Together, we can make that change. [Verse 1: James Taylor, Charlie Puth, Both]. Look around, there are too many of us crying. And not enough love to go around, oh-oh, oh. What a waste, another day. Another good one dyin'. But I know that the world will change. The day we know we're all the same. . [Chorus: Charlie Puth]. Why can't we just get along?. If loving one another's wrong. Then how are we supposed to. Get close to each other?. We gotta make that change, yeah. Why can't we just get along? Mmm. . [Verse 2: James Taylor, Charlie Puth, Both]. What a waste it would be to deny somebody. Of a chance to be theirselves (Mmm). What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing. But I know that the world can change. The day we know we're all the same. . [Chorus: Charlie Puth]. (Why can't we just get along?) Why can't we just get along?. (Why can't we just get along?) If loving one another's wrong. (Why can't we just get along?) Then how are we supposed to. Get close to each other?. We gotta make that change, yeah. You might also like[Bridge: Charlie Puth]. I know we could break apart. We don't have to go that way. Not today, ooh. . [Chorus: Charlie Puth, James Taylor, Both]. Yeah, why can't we just get along?. If loving one another's wrong. Then how are we supposed to. Get close to, yeah (Oh, oh). (Why can't we just get along?) Why can't we just get along?. (Why can't we just get along?) If loving one another's wrong. (Why can't we just get along?) Then how are we supposed to. Get close to each other?. We gotta make that change, yeah. . [Outro: Charlie Puth]. That change, yeah23Embed
