Cold was the night and hard was the ground. They found her in a small grove of trees. Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found. She's too young to be out on the street. . [Chorus]. Why wasn't God watching?. Why wasn't God listening?. Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?. [Verse 2]. Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school. I was doing the best that I could. But she kept runnin' away from this world. These children are so hard to raise good. . [Chorus]. Why wasn't God watching?. Why wasn't God listening?. Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?. . [Bridge]. Close your eyes and count to ten. I will go and hide but then. Be sure to find me, I want you to find me. And we'll play all over, we'll play all over. We will play all over again. . [Verse 3]. There's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn. Wildflowers on a cross by the road. And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom. As the hills turn from green back to gold. . [Chorus]. Why wasn't God watching?. Why wasn't God listening?. Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?.
