I had a dream that you were near. But yet so far from here. There's a new star in the sky tonight. It shines so bright for you. Just know. I saw you first. I saw you. I loved you. Admired you. I sought you out. I hunted you down. (Down, down, down). I hunted you down. (Down, down, down). . (Saumatic Coop). I've seen it before. Put the blade in you diaphram. An honorable seppuku. Exonoratable residue. It's me or you. Light the pipe, then bis adieu. Quite the sight. A dinner tool was cleverly used. I am cunning or insane. I am hungry for your pain. I am dapper and deranged. Stakes are clear. Fakes are near. Snakes are here. Right under your nose is where the truth is exposed. They stand by like vultures awaiting. The peak of your vulnerability. The peak of your vulnerability. The anticipation is killing me. The peak of your vulnerability. . . (Chorus). I had a dream that you were near. But yet so far from here. There's a new star in the sky tonight. It shines so bright for you. Just know. I saw you first. I saw you. I loved you. Admired you. I sought you out. I hunted you down. (Down, down, down). I hunted you down. (Down, down, down). You might also like. (Ace The Fcking Boss). I do not die like cyborg. I am a alien for sure. Feeling like Sith and a lord. No need to breathe anymore. Die at the end of my sword. Waken the depths of my heart. Created creature for war. Sparking the spartan to spar. Let my blood be the allure. Skyward we soar. Find you and feast for the fall, yeah. Consider this an invasion. Finding your planets, we take 'em. Don't wanna kneel, then we make 'em. Your morals are nothing, we break 'em. Crossing the heavens in arcs. Legacies none but a spark. Patience will yield the award. So we await to embark. For the next kingdom to storm. . . (Chorus). I had a dream that you were near. But yet so far from here. There's a new star in the sky tonight. It shines so bright for you. Just know. I saw you first. I saw you. I loved you. Admired you. I sought you out. I hunted you down. (Down, down, down). I hunted you down. (Down, down, down)Embed
