History's been leaning on me lately. I can feel the future breathing down my neck. And all the things I thought were true. When I was young, and you were too. Turned out to be broken. And I don't know what comes next. . [Chorus 1]. In a world that has decided. That it's going to lose its mind. Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind. [Verse 2]. They've started raising walls around the world now. Like hackles raised upon a cornered cat. On the borders, in our heads. Between things that can and can't be said. We've stopped talking to each other. And there's something wrong with that. . [Chorus 2]. So before you go out searching. Don't decide what you will find. Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind. . [Bridge]. You should know you're not alone. And trouble comes, and trouble goes. How this ends, no one knows. So hold on tight when the wind blows. . [Verse 3]. The wind blew both of us to sand and sea. And where the dry land stands is hard to say. As the current drags us by the shore. We can no longer say for sure. Who's drowning, or if they can be saved. You might also like[Chorus 3]. But when you're out there floundering. Like a lighthouse I will shine. Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind. . [Chorus 4]. Like a beacon reaching out. To you and yours from me and mine. Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind. . [Chorus 1]. In a world that has decided. That it's going to lose its mind. Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kindEmbed
