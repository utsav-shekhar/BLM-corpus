The women of the highway do their best to get by. My best is unrealized. The worst is when the best goes untried. You can call it fear of failure, dying to succeed. The wind blows at closed windows.

Feel the sheet rock rattle below. See the confidence surely grow. With an army of days reflected through the haze. Wisdom will accumulate. . We can work it out. We’re not heroes no.
