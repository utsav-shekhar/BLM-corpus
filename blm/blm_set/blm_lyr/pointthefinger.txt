Poor little Johnny didn't live to see sixteen. Gun made his lung collapse. Buried the body of his brother the next week. Cops shot him twice in the back. Wrong floor, kicked down the door. No questions asked. (Police mothafucka). Eyes meet, both on their feet. They open fire before he can speak. [Chorus]. Wrong place, wrong time. Stay out the streets is what they mama said. Dead man, no crime. School boys, they never broke a law. Anywhere, any time. They shoot first and ask questions last. Could be yours, could be mine. And then they point the finger at you. (And then they point the finger at you). . [Verse 2]. Unarmed, it don't matter, you can get got. Your own home, it don't matter, you can get shot. They feel fear and start squeezing that gat. They shoot to kill, now you're flat on your back. Dead witness, no coincidence. Drug deal gone bad (Drug deal gone bad). The fuckin' badge is the biggest gang. We've ever had. . [Chorus]. Wrong place, wrong time. Dealer dead, no drugs, no cash. Dead man, no crime. Cops shot him, said he reached for a gun. Anywhere, any time. They shoot first and ask questions last. Could be yours, could be mine. And then they point the finger at you. You might also like[Bridge]. How many more innocent people and kids gotta get killed by these police, man?. And then it's always the victim's fault. This is some fuckin' bullshit. . [Chorus]. Wrong place, wrong time. They shoot first and ask questions last. Dead man, no crime. And then they point the finger at youEmbed
