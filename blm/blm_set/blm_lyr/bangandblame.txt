If you could see yourself now, baby. It's not my fault. You used to be so in control. You're going to roll right over this one. Just roll me over, let me go. You're laying blame. Take this as no, no, no, no, no. . [Chorus]. You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And blame, blame, blame. You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's not my thing, so let it go. [Verse 2]. If you could see yourself now, baby. The tables have turned. The whole world hinges on your swings. Your secret life of indiscreet discretions. I'd turn the screw and leave the screen. Don't point your finger. You know that's not my thing. . [Chorus]. You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And blame, blame, blame. You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's not my thing, so let it go now. . [Verse 3]. You've got a little worry. I know it all too well. I've got your number. But so does every kiss and tell. Who dares to cross your threshold. Or happens on you way. Stop laying blame. You know that's not my thing. . [Chorus]. You know that's not my thing. You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And blame, blame, blame. You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's not my thing, so let it go. You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And blame, blame, blame. You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's not my thing, so let it go.
