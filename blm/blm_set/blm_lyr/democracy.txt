Broken dreams, broken hope. The world is on the edge. The eve of conflict, dawn of war. Misery the pledge. Politics of madmen leading to catastrophe. Democracy on its knees, fascist brutality. See them marching, see them walk. Hear them shouting, hear them talk. See them dominate the streets. When history repeats. [Chorus 1]. Condemned to watch on our TV screens. Powerless, ruled by machines. Propaganda, mind control. Beaten down, left to crawl. . [Verse 2]. Insanity electеd by the people bеing fooled. Civil rights and common sense disposed and overruled. When streets become the battlefields, and cities start to burn. It's time to take some action and to make the tables turn. Violence, regicide. Last resort, bona fide. . [Chorus 2]. When the voice of protest dies unheard. Tears of anger, vision blurred. Vicious cycle, planting hate. No turning back, it's too late. . [Bridge]. Escalation, firing shots. Placing votes from the rooftop. . Insanity elected by the people being fooled. Civil rights and common sense disposed and overruled. Reign of terror, money greed. Exploitation beyond the need. Civil unrest, knell of war. Uncertain outcome, death for sure. Minorities, weak oppressed. Law enforcement on their chest. Overpower, clash of classes. It's the few against the masses.

Malice raging on the loose. Blazing flames, the night turns red. Pile up the bodies, count the dead1Embed
