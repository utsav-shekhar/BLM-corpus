Can't stop the bum rush. A million strong and we all bust. We didn't fall prey to your bullshit lies. Propaganda of twisted minds. We figured out how it's all set up. The object, keep us all split up. Keep us fighting amongst ourselves. While you accumulate all the wealth. White on black, black on white. Muslim hatred, it's all hype. Spread the terror, fear of war. Billions spent on a fuckin' wall. It's all twisted, the game is bent. Still no clean water in Flint. But we ain't asleep no more, we're woke. Hear us comin'. See the smoke. [Chorus]. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. . [Verse 2]. Feel the power as we come. As we all move as one. If the street gangs could unite. Cops gonna get real polite. Politics (Politics). Lies (Lies). To conquer you must survive. But we ain't asleep no more, we're woke. Hear us comin'. See the smoke. . [Chorus]. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. . [Post-Chorus]. Body count. Body count. Body count. Body count. You might also like[Verse 3]. I'm not your enemy, you're not mine. Those who don't listen are blind. All together unstoppable. Some may say impossible. I believe. See the crowd. Feel the power. Hear the sound. We ain't asleep no more, we're woke. Hear us comin'. See the smoke. . [Chorus]. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. You can't stop the bum rush. . [Post-Chorus]. Body count. Body count. Body count. Body count. [Outro]. You can't stop the bum rushEmbed
