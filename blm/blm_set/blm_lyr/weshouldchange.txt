Shout-out to Premier. Primo. . [Chorus: D'Angelo]. Fuck the slice, want the pie. Why ask why 'til we fry. Watch us all stand in line. For a slice of the devil's pie. Drugs and thugs, women, wine. Three or four at a time. Watch them all stand in line. For a slice of the devil's pie. [Verse 1: D'Angelo]. Who am I to justify. All the evil in our eye. When I myself feel the high. Of all that I despise. Behind the jail or in the grave. I have to lay in this bed I made. If I die before I wake. I hope the Lord don't hesitate. To get to heaven, went through hell. Tell my peeps all is well. All them fools whose soul's for sale. Sitting next to the Jezebel. Demons screaming in my ear. All my anger, all my fear. If I holler let them hear. In this spinning sphere. . [Chorus: D'Angelo]. Fuck the slice, want the pie. Why ask why 'til we fry. Watch us all stand in line. For a slice of the devil's pie. Drugs and thugs, women, wine. Three or four at a time. Watch them all stand in line. For a slice of the devil's pie. You might also like[Verse 2: D'Angelo]. Main ingredients to this dish. Goes like this, here's the list. Materialistic, greed and lust. Jealousy, envious. Bread and dough, cheddar cheese. Flash and stash, cash and cream. Temperature's at a high degree. Where niggas come to feast. Hell is this all about. Apocalypse, ain't no doubt. Everybody's hoing out. All the loot, all the clout. Right or wrong, wo or die. Only the vengeance will pacify. Watch your back, so will I. In these days and time. . [Chorus: D'Angelo]. Fuck the slice, want the pie. Why ask why 'til we fry. Watch us all stand in line. For a slice of the devil's pie. Drugs and thugs, women, wine. Three or four at a time. Watch them all stand in line. For a slice of the devil's pie. [Outro: D'Angelo, DJ Scratch]. Man (Yeah). I think we should change the pace, slow it down for the ladies. What do you think?.
