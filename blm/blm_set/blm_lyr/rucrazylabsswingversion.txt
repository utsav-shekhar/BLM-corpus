There ain't no need to cry no more. When you break my heart into twenty four. I'll pick up the pieces you left. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. I ain't your mister, 'cause I'm breakin' up with ya. Shoulda' lay down with your sister. Go now, here's my middle finger. . [Chorus]. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?. Must be stupid if you think that we can start again. Are you joking, must be joking. You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'. Must be crazy if you think that we can start again. Come on now. [Verse 2]. Yeah, I'm with the fellas, hit the town. Let's go see what kind of chick knocks me out. Ohh, now she wants me back. Nothing sounds more better than "Hit the road, Jack, Jack". Woah, now don't call me mister, cause' I've broken up with ya. Sure, I lay down with your sister. Go now, here's my middle finger. . [Pre-Chorus]. 'Cause I'm hurting baby, hurting baby. Look what you did. . [Chorus]. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?. Must be stupid if you think that we can start again. Are you joking, must be joking. You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'. Must be crazy if you think that we can start again. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?. Must be stupid if you think that we can start again. Are you joking, must be joking. I ain't smokin'. Must be crazy if you think that we can start again. You might also like[Bridge]. Now I say.
