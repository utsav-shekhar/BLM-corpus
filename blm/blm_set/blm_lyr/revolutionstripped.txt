All my wolves, begin to howl. Wake me up, the time is now. Oh, can you hear the drumming?. Oh, there's a revolution coming. . [Verse 1]. Wide awake, the fever burns. Sweat it out, wait my turn. Can you hear the drumming?. There's a revolution coming. All this doubt is creepin' in. Inside out, I shed my skin. Can you hear the drumming?. There's a revolution coming. [Pre-Chorus 1]. I been waitin' all my life. To live, when I've only been dreaming. Get love when I've only been stealing. Can't let time keep passing me by. Run down what I've always been chasing. Black out every fear I've been facing. . [Chorus]. All my wolves, begin to howl. Wake me up, the time is now. Oh, can you hear the drumming?. Oh, there's a revolution coming. Wild things that turn me on. Drag my dark into the dawn. Oh, can you hear the drumming?. Oh, there's a revolution coming. . [Verse 2]. Body aches, I'm bound in chains. Well there's a fire in my veins and. Can you hear the drumming?. There's a revolution coming. Like every king who lost a crown. And all those years are history now. Can you hear the drumming?. There's a revolution coming. You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]. I been waitin' all my life. Run down what I've always been chasing. Black out every fear I've been facing. . [Chorus].
