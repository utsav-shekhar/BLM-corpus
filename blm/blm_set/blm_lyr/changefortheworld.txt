Revelation, we livin' in. Am I dreamin'? Who is gonna protect us now?. Rap back to color, Blacks depreciated. If we're not careful, we'll be back segregated. Change for the better of your soul. . [Chorus]. We gotta change our love. Change our love. We gotta change for the world. Change for the world. I got to give you my love. Give you my love. [Verse 2]. If you don't do me right now. Just check yourself. And I ain't afraid to love ya. See? I come with open arms. Stop hiding behind religion. Hate is poison in the blood. Heaven is crime, the world is shakin'. God is unhappy, the moon is breakin'. Blood is spillin', God is comin'. What are ya gonna do?. Shout them lines, take this love. Put away the guns, and take this love. . [Chorus]. We gotta change our love. Change our love. We gotta change for the world. Change for the world. I got to give you my love. Give you my love. If you don't do me right now. Just check yourself. . [Bridge]. Change the false preaches; change the hate in you. You might also like[Chorus]. We gotta change our love. Change our love. We gotta change for the world. Change for the world. I got to give you my love. Give you my love. Changing, changing. Change for the world. Changin' for this world. All over the world. Give you my love. Change. Change for the world. Change the world. Change the worldEmbed
