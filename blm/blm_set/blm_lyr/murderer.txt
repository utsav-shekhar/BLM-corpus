I see them lie and lay in wait. Standing at the gate. But yay I hold up my head and I sing. Hear what I sing nah.... . [Chorus]. Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder. Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow. Murder! Your insides must be hollow. How does it feel to take the life of another?. Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder. Kill me today you cannot kill I tomorrow. Murder! Your insides must be hollow. How does it feel to take a life?. [Verse 1]. You can hide from man but not your conscience. Unnu nyam the bread of sorrow, drink the wine of violence. Allowed yourself to be conquered by the serpent. Why you disobey the first commandment?. Walk through the valley I fear no pestilence. God is my witness and him ah meh evidence. Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help. You will never escape this judgement. . [Chorus]. Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder. Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow. Murder! Your insides must be hollow. How does it feel to take a life?. . [Verse 2]. I tell you, all men are created equal. But behind the trigger its a different sequel. Some ah murder people just to collect medals. Stop commit dirty acts for the high officials. You could wash your head until you can't wash no more. It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure. Upper class you could be rich, middle class whether you poor. Only the righteous won't feel insecure. You ever think about your skull getting bored? (buck buck!). [Chorus]. Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder. Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow. Murder! Your insides must be hollow. How does it feel to take a life?. . [Verse 3]. Drinking sulphur bitters won't bitter like your end. Only God can help you, no family no friend. Don't let the curse be upon your children's children. Abednigo, Shadreck, Meshek, Daniel in the den. Jonah in the whale's belly, but him never condemned. Job with the leprosy, and he still reached heaven. He will do for you everything He has done for them. . [Chorus]. Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder. Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow. Murder! Your insides must be hollow. How does it feel to take a life?. . [Verse 4]. You can hide from man but not your conscience. Unnu nyam the bread of sorrow, drink the wine of violence. Allowed yourself to be conquered by the serpent. Why you disobey the first commandment?. Walk through the valley I fear no pestilence. God is my witness and him ah meh evidence. Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help. You will never escape this judgement. [Chorus]. Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder. Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow. Murder! Your insides must be hollow. How does it feel to take a life?. . [Verse 5]. I tell you, all men are created equal. But behind the trigger its a different sequel. Some ah murder people just to collect medals. Stop commit dirty acts for the high officials. You could wash your head until you can't wash no more. It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure. Upper class you could be rich, middle class whether you poor5Embed
