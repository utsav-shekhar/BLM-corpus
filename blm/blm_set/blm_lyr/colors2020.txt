Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors. . [Verse 1]. I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'. King of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'. Livin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse. Vendettas of death, back the colors I choose. Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter. Sucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters. The gangs of L.A. will never die, just multiply, colors. [Chorus]. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors. . [Verse 2]. You don't know me, fool. You disown me, cool. I don't need your assistance, social persistence. Any problem I got I just put my fist in. My life is violent but violent is life. Peace is a dream, reality is a knife. My colors, my honor, my colors, my all. With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall. Tell me, what have you left me? What have I got?. Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot. My homeboy got jacked. My mother's on crack. My sister can't work 'cause her arms shows tracks. Madness, insanity, live in profanity. Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me. Give me a break, what world do you live in?. Death is my set, guess my fucking religion. You might also like[Chorus]. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors, colors. Colors, colors. . [Verse 3]. My pants are saggin', braided hair. Suckas stare, I don't care. My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear. I've no remorse so squares beware. But my true mission is just revenge. You ain't in my set, you ain't my friend. Wear the wrong color, your life could end. Homicide's my favorite binge, colors. . [Chorus]. Colors, co-co-co-colors. Colors, co-co-co-colors. Colors, co-co-co-colors. Colors, co-co-co-colors. Colors, co-co-co-colors. Colors, colors. Colors, colors. Colors. [Verse 4]. So I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant. You'll say to stop, but I'll say that I can't. My gang's my family, they're all that I have. I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph. You don't like it, so you know where you can go. The streets are my stage and terror's my show. Psycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?. It wasn't your brother that brutally died. But it was mine, so let me define. My territory, don't cross the line. Don't try to act crazy 'cause that shit don't faze me. If you ran like a bitch, it wouldn't amaze me. 'Cause my color's death. Though we all want peace. But our war won't end. 'Til all wars ceaseEmbed
