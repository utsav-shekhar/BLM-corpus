Woah, oh. . [Verse 1]. Who's that man I see. Underneath the hanging tree?. He looks just like me. So tell me, am I really free?. Coulda been my mother, crying for my brother. And everybody, everybody, everybody's praying for peace. But who's gonna protect us from the police?. [Chorus]. Keep these chains off me. 'Cause I don't wanna be another seed underneath the hanging tree. Pray for me. Lord, don't let me be another seed underneath the hanging tree. . [Verse 2]. Brands on our bodies (The color of fruit). Color of purple fruit (Shoo-doot). Power of the black dollar (Black dollars, black dollars). Spent on designers that don't give a damn about you. I, I wonder sometimes. Am I just living to die? (Living to die). 'Cause the way they do my kind, I just wanna cry. . [Chorus]. Chains off me. I don't wanna be another seed underneath the hanging tree. Pray for me. Lord, don't let me be another seed underneath the hanging tree. . [Instrumental Break]. . [Refrain]. Take these chains off me. Free me. I don't wanna be another seed underneath the hanging tree. Take these chains off me. Free me. Lord don't let me be another seed underneath the hanging tree. Take these chains off meYou might also like1Embed
