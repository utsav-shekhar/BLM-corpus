Cathedral to the congregation. Congregation, rise and let us pray. As I'm rotatin' with my true playa partner by the name of IDK. We tryna figure out, when in doubt. Why all this petty shit gotta come our way, you know what I'm sayin'?. Put an end to the mothafuckin' hate. Let us rise and let us get straight, you know what I'm sayin'?. We gotta demonstrate, we gotta congregate. And, through this bullshit, man. We ain't gon' do none but aim and penetrate (Penetrate). (Ism). [Verse 1: IDK]. Why all my brothers tryna infiltrate my circle?. Why all my sisters tryna spin my wheel and chase my cheddar. 'Round and 'round like these women turnin' into gerbils?. Guess the family mattered less when I was more an Urkel. Yeah, but now I'm Stefan'd up. And everything I do is everything that they fond of. It's funny how I went from paperboy to makin' that paper, boy. But I'm still tryna throw it at houses. My credit was fucked up, but now it's in fair condition. I'm tellin' the banks to help a brother, they never listen. Like almost every nigga in the world with the chains and the girls. Goin' through the same struggle, just from a distance. We think they winnin', and speakin' of winnin', the Redskins losin'. That's a representation of where I'm from. 'Cause when the guns pop, we lose a life and that's the real conclusion. We watch 'em change the channel while we make excuses. . [Chorus: IDK]. He was just a drug dealer. Record wasn't clean so we see him as a thug nigga. (Police described the shooting victim as a known drug dealer— change the channel). He was just a crazy man. He blew up the school just to mothafuckin' say he can. (Students evacuating with their hands up, the suspect in the mass shooting— change the channel). I love this girl, this girl loves me. Even though I'm a girl, too, she my—. (The newly updated Marriage Rules Act gives same-sex couples. The same rights as heterosexual couples— change the channel). Aw, fuck it, we all brothers and sisters. We all brothers and sisters, we all brothers and—. You might also like[Post-Chorus]. (Ooh). Paper is power still (Ooh). Paper is power still. Paper is power still, paper is power still (Ooh). Paper is power still, paper is power still (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah). My hittas separate from petty to stupid shit. I threw an oop to them like Zion and Duke and them. . [Verse 2: IDK]. Why every time I see a white person I question myself, like. "Am I gonna scare 'em 'cause I'm black?". But when I put my white voice on and ask him for directions. He just gives 'em to me with a dap. And then smiles, see, not everybody racist and shit. But we just tryna be prepared for all the hatred we get. 'Cause if I make the wrong turn and stop at a gas station. Listen, there's a small chance that I could probably be lynched. In 2019, and probably still in 2020. And probably 20 years later 'cause this shit ain't gon' leave. It's never gon' end, that's why I gotta scribble this pen. 'Cause I got a voice and no one in my generation don't ever say shit. 'Cause it ain't cool to talk like this. But chalk lines tracin' of bodies make me jot my shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah). My job is this, say truth to make your jawlines drip. So if I get flipped, this message is in all my hits.
