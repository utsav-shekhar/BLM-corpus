A grizzly scene on my electron beam. Told a story about human rights. So all the King's horses and all the King's men. Had a riot for two days and nights. Well, the city exploded, but the gates wouldn't open. So the company asked him to quit. Now everybody's equal. Just don't measure it. . [Verse 2]. Well, Hanson did it to Hester. And Mark David did it to John. And maybe Jack did it to Marilyn. But he did it to South Vietnam. For beauty and glory. For money, love, and country. Now everybody's doing it. Don't do that to me. [Verse 3]. A bitter debate and a feminine fate. Lie in tandem like two precious babes. While the former gets warmer, it's the latter that matters. Except on the nation's airwaves. And custodians of public opinion stayed back. After vainly discussing her rights. Lay hands off her body. It's not your fucking life. . [Verse 4]. Now I don't know what stopped Jesus Christ. From turning every hungry stone into bread. And I don't remember hearing how Moses reacted. When the innocent first born sons lay dead. Well, I guess God was a lot more demonstrative. Back when he flamboyantly parted the sea. Now everybody's praying. Don't pray on me. Said everybody's praying. Don't pray on meYou might also likeEmbed
