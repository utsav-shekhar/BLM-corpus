Everybody knows shit's fucked. I don't give a good goddamn, your Uncle Sam is a motherfucker. I don't wanna see him again. Have to pretend, count to ten. . [Verse 1]. You blew up your towers to justify a war. Well I don't really care what your arms are for. More money on defense; fuck hospitals. Fuck human beings, fuck humanity. Fuck human beings, fuck humanity. Fuck human beings, fuck humanity. Fuck human beings, fuck humanity. [Verse 2]. The country I was born in sold its soul to you motherfuckers. You patrol both sides of the border. No, I don't wanna listen to your order. New World Order, New World Order. Haven't got anything to lose. 40 years old, half-dead, got a noose in my hands. Somebody gave it to me. I don't want it, no, I don't want it, unh!. . [Pre-Chorus]. You patrol both sides of the borders. You patrol both sides of the borders. . [Chorus]. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. . [Verse 3]. There's no explanation for the third building. Falling, toppling, extinct we sing. Over what we are as a race. We don't face the fact; the government fucks us in the ass. Creating another Pearl Harbor, killin' its own kind. What for?. Oh, I don't know motherfucker. I guess money's on the mind. You might also like[Chorus]. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. . [Bridge]. Everybody knows shit's fucked. Everybody knows shit's fucked. . [Outro]. Everybody knows shit's fucked!. Everybody knows shit's fucked!. Everybody knows shit's fucked!. Mm, everybody knows shit's fucked!7Embed
