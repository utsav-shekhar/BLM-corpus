Thank God!. I prayed about my decision. How odd. For the man with the mic. To be the man all his life. Rock Christ, like Stipe’s did with R.E.M. Rev up the RPMs. How do I begin to try to paint this sin. Of rules?. That divide God’s people in two.. In the beginning, religion created a mask. The reformation helped, but soon the patch didn't last.. I don’t tell, you don’t ask. So we created a lie. And for generations, church was where we went to go hide. Or we no longer tried. Because a rules read-out relationship is empty inside,. Leaves you bitter, dry. Swift to cut like a razor. Swift to call you a traitor. 'Cause you swift to love Taylor. Now we got bad blood with our neighbor. Who’s wrong, who’s right?. Every Sunday we're divided. Who’s black, who’s white?. Shamone!!. . Now the Man in the Mirror never gets race right. He’ll never be Christ-like. Never receive good pay. So your faith never rises above minimum wage. So when it’s time to save the world (heh). You don’t know what to say. To your brother that you love when he tells you he’s gay.. Do you push him away?. Judge him down till he leaves?. Give him a gospel he hears or a gospel he sees?. Love wrapped in truth is the gospel he needs!. There's the room at the cross for everyone, even me.. Well, my sins are now clean, the lost are redeemed,. Religion is a prison but truth sets us free. Helps us believe that the world we're in now is not the world that will be.. Terror, famine, disease,. Millions in poverty,. Hungry, can’t sleep,. With all this religion why these babies can’t eat?. And if the middle class is gone how can America see?. How can America breathe. when the Oxygen is gone from the American dream?. And these American streets listen close as they speak,. “The next time you think 'America', please include me!”. Help the ones that are weak,. All they want is a piece. Of the pie that you keep,. Is that too much for those that laid the concrete?. Still laying on concrete. Pop, Pop, by police. See, they the foundation of the nation, not the 2%. Not the ones that own the building that the middle-class rent. Because they make cents.. . Tell me, how do you feel?. I'm the new Franklin and I have the new deal.. I fight and do right. FDR for real. One nation under God. God, show us the way.. The science of opinion:. God is not a buffet.. You pick what you want so no God on your plate. The preacher isn't God. Religion's first mistake. Serving stewards, shepherds, not kings;. Has to die to his flesh everyday like me. One VIP. All the other seats in church are free. We're just groupies. God's the celebrity. . Before 313 AD. Before Constantine. Before the Council of Nicaea. Before Romans and Greeks. Before Calvin, Alexander, Luther. Before "Let there be". Before history. To the last century. Before the death on the tree. Before the fall of man. Was a picture of me,. Nailed to his heart. Right before the last three words he would speak:. “IT IS FINISHED!”. Can you believe?. . I’m losing my religion. Thank God!. Helping you lose yours. is my job.2Embed
