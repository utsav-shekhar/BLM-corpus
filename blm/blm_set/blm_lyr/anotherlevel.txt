I didn't fall to negativity, I stayed strong. I pushed past all adversity and hate. You never believed in anything I tried to do. All my dreams to you were nothin' but a fuckin' waste. I elevated my grind, I rose above the pain. I came, I conquered, never quit, yes, I fuckin' won. Now you're hatin' 'cause I'm winnin' and you fuckin' lost. You said I'd never be shit. . [Chorus]. Now I'm on another level. A whole different level. I'm on a different fuckin' level. Now I'm on another level. I'm on another level. A whole different level. I'm on a different fuckin' level. [Verse 2]. No way that you could bring me down, you can't get in my brain. Your life is miserable, I'm on a higher plane. All you non-believers, I chose to beat the game. They said I didn't have what it takes. . [Chorus]. Now I'm on another level. A whole different level. I'm on another level. . [Bridge]. Yeah, you know what it's like. First startin' out. You got dreams, everybody got dreams. Nobody believes. Nobody believes you're gonna, you're gonna pull it off. They say why waste your time. I was in the hood, they say, "Ice. Just get high with us man, just chill man. You ain't never gonna get outta here". That's some bullshit. "We black, man, we're supposed to be poor". I was like, "fuck that shit". Man, there's things I got to do with my life man. I ain't gonna lay around here. I'm gonna bust my mothafuckin' ass whether you believe in me or not. I hustle my ass off night and mothafuckin' day.

A whole different level. I'm on a different fuckin' levelEmbed
