She looked out the window and said, "The world's on fire". That's when I laughed and poured her a glass of wine. We just stared at the TV tryin' to find some meanin'. Hopin' that we'd wake up from this dream. Sometime tomorrow. . [Verse 2]. Well the night came and went, not a damn thing had changed. That's when I saw a tear fall from her eyes.

And we've only begun to fight. We just can't give in, we just can't give up. We must go boldly into the darkness. And be the light. . [Verse 3]. So I packed up my car and went lookin' for answers.

This ain't the country my grandfather fought for. But I still see the hate he fought against. Give rest to the tired, give mercy to the poor. Give warmth to the huddled masses. And I'll show you freedom. . [Chorus]. The load is heavy and the road is long. And we've only begun to fight. We just can't give in, we just can't give up. We must go boldly into the darkness. And be the light. You might also like[Verse 5]. I got a baby girl comin' in the spring. I worry 'bout the world she's comin' into. But she'll have my fight, she'll have her mama's fire.

We must go boldly into the darkness. . [Chorus]. The load is heavy and the road is long. And we've only begun to fight. We just can't give in, we just can't give up. We must go boldly into the darkness. And be the lightEmbed
