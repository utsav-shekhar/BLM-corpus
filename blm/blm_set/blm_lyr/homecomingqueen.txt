Ooh, I remember looking at magazines. And never saw anyone quite like me. It was hard. It was hard for me. I would never speak up out of turn. 'Bout those blonde, blue-eyed girls, they were beautiful. But it was hard. Hard for me to dream. . [Chorus]. I'll be my own homecoming queen. As long as it feels good to me. I'll be the boss of this town. You'll be your own homecoming queen. Forget all the shit that you've seen. Put on my crown. [Verse 2]. When I was a teenager. Awkward body hair and big derri√©re. It was harder. So much harder than it seemed. I am a woman now. I feel beautiful and I love myself. But it was hard. To get used to me. . [Chorus]. I'll be my own homecoming queen. As long as it feels good to me. I'll be the boss of this town. You'll be your own homecoming queen. Forget all the shit that you've seen. Put on my crown. . [Bridge]. 'Cause in 1967, I wasn't human. And in 1994, I was born. I am still here. We are still here. . [Chorus]. I'll be my own homecoming queen. As long as it feels good to me. I'll be the boss of this town. You'll be your own homecoming queen. Forget all the shit that you've seen. Put on my crown. You might also like[Outro]. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crown. Put on my crownEmbed
