And I hope they hear our call. Maybe it's a woman. Or a black man after all. . Lookin' for a leader. To bring our country home. Reunite the red white and blue. Before it turns to stone. . Lookin' for somebody. With the strength to take it on. Keep us safe together. And make this country strong. Walkin' among our people. There's someone to lead us on. Need a rainbow of colors. In a broken world gone wrong. . Yeah we had Barack Obama. And we really need him now. The man who stood behind him. Has to take his place somehow. . America has a leader. Buildin' walls around our house. Who don't know black lives matter. And we got to vote him out. . We got our election. But corruption has a chance. We got to have a big win. To regain confidence. . America is beautiful. But she has an ugly side. We're lookin' for a leader. In this country far and wide. . Just like his big new fence. This president's going down. America's moving forward. You can feel it in every town. You might also likeScared of his own shadow. Buildin' walls around our house. He's hiding in his bunker. Something else to lie about. . We don't need a leader. Building walls around our house. Who don't know black lives matter. And it's time to vote him out. . We're lookin' for a leader. With the great spirit on his side. Lookin' for a leader. In this country far and wide. . We're lookin' for a leader. With the great spirit on his side1Embed
