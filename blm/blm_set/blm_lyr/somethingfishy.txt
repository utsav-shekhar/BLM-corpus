There must be something fishy going on. You said you were going on a fishing trip with some old friend. You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten. Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home. I think there's something fishy going on. . [Verse 2]. I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line. I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind. But you never asked me if I'd like to go along. So there must be something fishy going on. [Chorus]. There's something fishy going on. On these fishing trips you're going on. I'm getting tired of staying home alone. . [Bridge]. Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone. You can bet there's something fishy going' on. . [Verse 3]. I guess some largemouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt. I don't think you're a fisherman, honey. I think you're a flirt. Well if you're going fishing then why don't you bring them home. I think there's something fishy going on. . [Chorus]. There's something fishy going on. On these fishing trips you're going on. I'm getting tired of staying home alone. . [Outro]. Yes, you can bet there's something fishy going onYou might also likeEmbed
