Raatbhar soya nai aaj. Baby just call me up, can't you?. Milengey mahino baad. Aaye na mujhe bhi chain kyu?. Baby, I wait for your call. Tell me I'm crazy in love. Sun ni thi teri aawaj. Kyu aise leri hai jaan. Beete arse, bhulaye gum, yaad aaye teri roz kyu?. Feel that I never moved on, I just learned living up with those wounds. Remember back I told you, trust me I wouldn't lie at all. Haa mujhe na hai khauf. Dil bhi dukha hai bohot. De di hai jaan, yu lage Saza-E-Maut. My God!. For all of the times that both of us spent. Thank you. But I cannot fall for nobody else. Zubaan pe us hi ka naam. Nai bhulunga yaade. Tu nai mila. Tu ruk hi gayi saas. Hai tujhe dua. Yu mujhe talaash thi. Kyu tere pyaar ki, toota dil. [Chorus: Gaush]. Why are you acting so cold?. I want you back in my home. But you wouldn't answer the phone, baby. . I said I crave for your love. Baby I said you the one. And I wouldn't leave you alone baby. . Yu hi tu aajana milne. Lage dua tujhe dil se. Can't wait to give you my all baby. . Why are you acting so cold?. I want you back in my home. But you wouldn't answer the phone, baby. . [Verse 2: Big Scratch]. I want you back in my life. I want you back in my home. I want you back on my bed. Wait. Maybe I don't. Mujhe ko lauta de tu feelings. Mujhe lauta de tu time. Aukaat se zyada di izzat. I don't want it back, you can't pay the price. I was upset then I realised. You were a burden all of this time. You didn't deserve it, thoda bhi nahi. And I was hurting, so i decided. I had to leave without a goodbye. Gave you my, all tu leti bhi gayi. I built up a wall, bahar aata nahi. Ab peeche deewaar ke naraaz hai kai. For all of the times that both of us spent. Wasted. You already fell for somebody else. Sawaal toh mera hai aaj bhi wahi. Ki raat ko soti hai chain se kaise. Jab janti, nahi koi saath mein. Dikhe us haath mein tere bas saikdo toote dil. You might also like[Chorus: Gaush, Big Scratch]. Why are you acting so cold?. I want you back in my home.
