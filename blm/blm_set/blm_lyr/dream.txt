. Lost inside a dream, What's it mean, is it real?. Character's are me, with some sheep, in a field. Looking at the sky to see me looking back down;. Mind blowing in the wind, hope the breeze stays 'round. In a valley that was as dark as it was cold. I was searching for the light to ignite my inner soul. I was lost; and so were you. That's how I knew we'd find our way to where the sky shined blue. Our lives are made up of what we experience and learn;. Even if your outlet was drugs you still get a turn. Base our feelings off of how our mind says that we feel. Although its only vibration, know that all this matter is real. We don't have much time, although it seems that we do. Seconds turn into minutes, a couple years and you're through. In a new age of thinking our thoughts are all that we have. Freedom of the mind in theory expressing why mine are rad. [Break: Ken Wilber]. . [Verse 2: Jesse]. . Man, its not that funny when you recognize that it's true. Seein' broken-hearted people enslaved down to their roots. Broken memories on floors of stained glass;. A past occurring with bad times, leave it at that. All feelin' that we're missing, trying to find our way home. A bullet in the chamber, collect call her from a pay phone. "Hey it's me, sorry this has to happen.". Cut her off with a bang and then all she heard was the static. .
