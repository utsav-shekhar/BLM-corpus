Kings and Queens and Presidents. Ministers of Governments. Welcome to the future of your world. Through talking heads that took liberties. The monkeys learn to build machines. They think they'll get to heaven through the universe. . [Pre-Chorus 1]. They say nothing. Deny everything. And make counter accusations. My friends, my dear, my love, my God. [Chorus]. There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (come out). There will be lots for them to talk about (about). There'll be trouble when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out, when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What you looking at. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You want a bit of that. Hey, hey, hey, hey. There will be trouble when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out. Hey. . [Verse 2]. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest of them all?. The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful. Because it's up hill and against the wind. With no-one there to let us in. Leave your thoughts and save yourself you fool. . [Pre-Chorus 2]. The daggers of science. Evolving into violence. We're not sure where the fallout blows. But we all know. You might also like[Chorus]. There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (come out). There will be lots for them to talk about (about). There'll be trouble when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out, when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What you looking at. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You want a bit of that. Hey, hey, hey, hey. There will be trouble when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out. Hey. . [Bridge]. Out on the streets tonight. They're making peace tonight. They're making peace. . [Outro]. La, la, la, la.... One, two, three, four. La, la, la, la.... As you are. There'll be trouble when the kidz come out. There will be lots for them to talk about. There'll be trouble when the kidz come out. When the kidz come out, when the kidz come out. There'll be trouble when the kidz come outEmbed
