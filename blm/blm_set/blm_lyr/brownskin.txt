Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin). I can't tell where yours begins. I can't tell where mine ends. Brown skin, up against my brown skin (Brown skin). Need some every now and then (Oh, yeah). . [Verse 1]. Where are your people from?. Maybe Mississippi or an island. Apparently your skin has been kissed by the sun. You make me wanna Hershey's kiss, your licorice. Every time I see your lips. It makes me think of honey-coated chocolate. Your kisses are worth more than gold to me. I'll be your almond joy, you'll be my sugar daddy. [Chorus]. Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin). I can't tell where yours begins. I can't tell where mine ends. Brown skin, up against my brown skin (Brown skin). Need some every now and then (Ooh, hey). . [Verse 2]. Every time you come around. Something magnetic pulls me and I can't get out. Disoriented, I can't tell my up from down. All I know is that I wanna lay you down. Every time I let you in. Abracadabra, magic happens as we swim. Higher and higher, finally we reach heaven. Come back to Earth and then we do it all again (Yeah). . [Chorus]. Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin). I can't tell where yours begins. I can't tell where mine ends. Brown skin, up against my brown skin (Brown skin). Need some every now and then (Oh, yeah). . [Bridge]. Skin so brown, lips so round. Baby, how can I be down? (Down). Beautiful mahogany. You make me feel like a queen (You make me feel like a queen). Tell me what's that thing you do. That makes me wanna get next to you, yeah (Yeah). Oh, oh, I want your. You might also like[Chorus]. Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin). I can't tell where yours begins. I can't tell where mine ends. Brown skin (Ooh), up against my brown skin (Brown skin). Need some every now and then (Need some every now and then, hey). Brown skin (Ooh), you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin). I can't tell where yours begins. I can't tell where mine ends (Hey). Brown skin (You know), up against my brown skin (Brown skin). Need some every now and then (Oh, yeah, oh). . [Outro]. Oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, oh, oh, ooh. Oh, oh, oh, hey4Embed
