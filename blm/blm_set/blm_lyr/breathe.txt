I love it here 'cause I don't have to explain to them. Why I'm beautiful, 'cause I am beautiful. Back home, they're scared, oh, so scared of me. That I became scared of me, I've become scared of me. . [Pre-Chorus]. The way you smile when you believe in your future is different, is different. The way you smile when you believe in your future is different, is different. . [Chorus]. Now we moving forward ever, backwards never. Forward ever, backwards never. And when the going gets rough and life gets tough. Don't forget to breathe. [Verse 2]. I love it here 'cause I don't have to explain to them. Why I'm valuable, that I'm magical. And back home, they tear, tear my soul apart. Love my broken heart, I don't know where to start. . [Pre-Chorus]. The way you smile when you believe in your future is different, is different. . [Chorus]. Now we moving forward ever, backwards never. Forward ever, backwards never. And when the going gets rough and life gets tough. Don't forget to breathe. . [Bridge]. Surely, I did not go through all of this for nothing. Yet nothing's such a beautiful word, hey, see. Baby, surely you did not go through all of this here for nothing. Yet nothing's such a beautiful word. 'Cause nothing can be loved into something. Nothing can be loved into something. (To something, to something). Nothing can be loved into something. (To something, to something). You might also like[Chorus]. Now we moving forward ever, backwards never. Forward ever, backwards never. And when the going gets rough and life gets tough.
