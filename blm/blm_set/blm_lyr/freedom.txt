Hold on to this feelin'. Freedom (Freedom!). Hold on to this feelin'. Freedom (Freedom!). . [Verse 1: Chali 2na]. Yo, seldom travelled by the multitude. The Devil's gavel has a couple fooled. My culture's screwed 'cause this word is misconstrued. Small countries exempt from food 'cause leader have different views. You choose. [Akil]. What meen the world to me is bein' free. Live and let live and just let it be (Let it be). Love peace and harmony, one universal family. One God, one aim and one destiny. . [Marc 7]. (Oh Yeah?) Imagine life without a choice at all. Given no hope without a voice at all. These be the problems that we face. I'm talkin' poverty and race. But no matter what the case we gotta. . [Chorus: Jurassic 5]. Hold on to this feelin'. Freedom (Freedom!). Hold on to this feelin'. Freedom (Freedom!). . [Verse 2: Soup]. Yo, I'm the first candidate to hate. Had to beat on the drum to communicate. For what was to come to those who were hung. They would decapitate the tongue if you would mention the word (Freedom). . [Chali 2na]. Got people screamin' free Mumia Jamal. But two out of three of y'all will probably be at the mall. I'm heated with y'all, the defeated will fall. Incomplete and unsolved when the word freedom's involved. You might also like[Akil]. Yo, my forefathers hung in trees to be free (Rest in peace). Got rid of slavery but still kept the penitentiary. And now freedom got a shotgun and shells with your name. Release the hot ones and let freedom reign. . [Soup]. I'm the former vote prisoner. Hollywood visitor. Dance for cats segregated on wax. My color got me handi-cap Amos and Andy. For the freedom they just won't hand me. . [Chorus]. Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!). Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!). . [Outro: Marc 7]. (Hold On). 'Cause there's not a lot of time (To). Your heart, body, soul and your mind (This). They're so true and they been hurtin' so long (Feelin'). That's the reason why we named this song (Freedom). (Hold On). 'Cause there's not a lot of time (To). Your heart, body, soul and your mind (This). They're so true and they been hurtin' so long (Feelin'). That's the reason why we named this song (Freedom)Embed
