Going to take it rock-bottom, going to take it to the top. . [Chorus]. Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard. And together we will take on all the world. Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard. And together we will take on all the world. [Verse 2]. Move a little nearer, you know you got to follow your leaders. Because we need you, like you need us for sure. We're going to drive you, we're going to ride you, we're going to get right inside you. And if you want to keep going, just shout out for more. . [Chorus]. Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard. And together we will take on all the world. Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard. And together we will take on all the world. . [Bridge]. Sing your song, we'll listen to you. Sing your song, the spotlights on you. . [Chorus]. Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard.

And together we will take on all the world. Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard. And together we will take on all the worldYou might also likeEmbed
