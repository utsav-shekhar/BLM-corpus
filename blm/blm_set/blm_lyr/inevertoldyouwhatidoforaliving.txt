Stay out of the light or the photograph that I gave you. You can say a prayer if you need to. Or just get in line and I'll grieve you. Can I meet you alone?. Another night and I'll see you. Another night and I'll be you. Some other way to continue. To hide my face. . [Pre-Chorus]. Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets. Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe. The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes. I keep a book of the names and those. [Chorus]. Only go so far 'til you bury them. So deep and down, we go. . [Verse 2]. Touched by angels, though. I fall out of grace. I did it all, so maybe. I'd live this every day. . [Pre-Chorus]. Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets. Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe. It ain't the money and it sure as hell ain't just for the fame. It's for the bodies I claim and those. . [Chorus]. Only go so far 'til you bury them. So deep and down, we go. . [Breakdown]. Down, and down we go, and down we go, and down we go. And we all fall down! I tried! I tried!. . [Chorus]. And we'll all dance along to the tune of your death. We'll love again, we'll laugh again, and it's better off this way. You might also like[Post-Chorus]. And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots. To the back of the head and we're all dead now. And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots. To the back of the head and we're all dead now. . [Ad-Libs]. I tried! One more night, one more night!. Well, I'm laughing out, crying out, laugh out loud!. I tried, well, I tried, well, I tried, 'cause I tried, but I lied, I lied!. I tried, I tried, I tried, well.... . [Bridge]. And we'll love again, we'll laugh again. We'll cry again, and we'll dance again. And it's better off this way, so much better off this way. I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed!. . [Post-Chorus]. And never again and never again, they gave us two shots. To the back of the head and we're all dead now...34Embed
