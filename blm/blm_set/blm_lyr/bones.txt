Oh child when you are weary. Weary deep down in your soul. Hear my voice rolling like a river. I won’t ever leave you alone. . [Chorus]. Ain’t no chain gonna hold you down. Ain’t no grave gonna hold you now. Yesterday dun came and gone. Ain’t it time to bury them bones. [Chorus]. Ain’t no chain gonna hold you down. Ain’t no grave gonna hold you now. Yesterday dun came and gone. Ain’t it time to bury them bones. . [Verse 2]. Oh child when you’re in darkness. Them devils circling around. Don’t you go thinking it’s hopeless. Takes some getting lost to be found. . [Chorus]. Ain’t no chain gonna hold you down. Ain’t no grave gonna hold you now. Yestеrday dun came and gone. Ain’t it time to bury thеm bones. . [Bridge]. Take me down to the river. Wash me clean in the water. Take me down to the river. Wash me clean in the water. Take me down to the river. Wash me clean in the water. Take me down to the river. Wash me clean in the water. Take me down to the river. Wash me clean in the water. Take me down to the river. Wash me clean in the water. You might also like[Chorus].
