Oh, I have ambitions, dreams. But dreams don't come cheap. . [Verse 1]. I saw a demon on my shoulder, it's lookin' like patriarchy. Like scrubbin' blood off the ceiling and bleachin' another carpet. How my house get haunted?. Why Toyin body don't embody all the life she wanted?. A baby, just nineteen. I know I dream all black. I seen her everything, immortalizin' tweets all caps. They say they found her dead. [Chorus]. One girl missin', another one go missin'. One girl missin', another. . [Verse 2]. But niggas in the back quiet as a church mouse. Basement studio when duty calls to get the verse out. I guess the ego hurt now. It's time to go to work, wow, look at him go. He really 'bout to write about me when the world is in smokes?. When it's people in trees?. When George was beggin' for his mother, saying he couldn't breathe. You thought to write about me?. . [Chorus]. One girl missin', another one go missin'. One girl missin', another one. . [Verse 3]. Yo, but little did I know all my readin' would be a bother. It's trans women bein' murdered and this is all he can offer?. And this is all y'all receive?. Distracting from the convo with organizers. They talkin' abolishin' the police. And this the new world order. We democratizin' Amazon, we burn down borders. This a new vanguard, this a new vanguard. I'm the new vanguardYou might also like14Embed
