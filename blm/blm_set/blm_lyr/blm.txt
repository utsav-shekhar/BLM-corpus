Lynval Golding, born 1951. Mendes, St Catherine, Jamaica. . [Verse 1]. The year was 1954, you know. Sir Winston Churchill shout across the Western islands. He said, "Come, help us rebuild this country devastated by war". And so anyway, my father set sail upon the wind rush, bound for a new life. My father was a tailor by trade. And so this could be the possibility of all possibilities. But no, there was no cloth to stitch. Instead, you know what?. He found work in a steel foundry. Pouring hot metal day and night, day and night. And even worse, you know what then?. Him tried to find a room to rent. This was becoming a nightmare for him. Him knock on door after door after door. But the sign on the window keep saying the same thing. "No dogs, no Irish, no blacks". Welcome to England. [Chorus]. I'm not here to teach you. I'm not here to preach to you. I just want to reach out. And say. . [Verse 2]. Time move on. In 1964, my father shout across Jamaica. "Son," him said, "Come join me". So I set sail on a ship called the Askena. When I reached Northampton on a cold winter's night. Boy, I was freezing. I want to tell the captain to just take me back to Jamaica. But no, I was here to stay. So my father sent me to a school. Linden Road school in Gloucester. I remember the first playtime. A boy shout across at me. "Oi, you black bastard, come 'ere". I said, "What?". He said, "Come 'ere, you black bastard". I still couldn't believe, I says, "What?. Are you talking to me?. Are you talking to me?". Boy, welcome to England. You might also like[Chorus]. I'm not here to teach you. I'm not here to preach to you. I just want to reach out. And say. . [Verse 3]. In 1994, I move again. The land of the free, the home of the brave. The United States of America. And there I was. Just walking along in the sun, minding my own business. Such a beautiful day, man, when I remember. I had to buy a watch on my sister's birthday. When why eventually I found this store. As I walk through the door. This woman in the store shouted at me. "What you doing here, you goddamn nigga?". I said, "I-I'm just, I'm just trying to buy a watch for my sister". When she heard my accent, she said. "Oh, you're not from here, you're not one of them". "One of them?" I said, "You mean me being black?. Well ma'am, let me tell you something right, I am black. Is that all you see? The color of my skin?". In England, them call you a black bastard. In America, they call you a goddamn nigga. Boy, welcome to my world. [Chorus]. But I'm not here to teach you. I'm not here to preach to you. I just want to reach out and say. Black lives matterEmbed
