Dear brother. When you gonna call back your mother?. She thinks you're sleeping in the gutter. We both know you can do better. When you gonna write your older brother. A letter?. Hey man I miss you, gettin' my shit together. And for the record. I wrote this note as a reminder. Hermano mio there's a future. We can believe in. It's gonna take more than songs of justice and freedom. There's a future you can believe in. Gonna take more than songs of justice and freedom. Freedom! Yeah. If you're thinking, about leaving. Hold my hand, understand this too can be a kingdom. Blessed. And when the rain comes. Put your hands in the dirt, baba this is where you came from. This is where you came from. This is where you came from. This is where you came from. Systems broken no fucks given. Wealthy people living off the backs of the broken. Dreams of America. Dreams of America. Need a pipe carrier. Let me smudge you off so the vision can get clearer. Your mothers crying boy can you hear her?. . [Pre-Chorus]. What I see, in you. A young tree bearing fruit. Place to start. Don't hide behind your heart. . [Chorus]. You gotta put down the weight. You gotta get out of your way. You gotta put down the weight. You gotta get out of your way. You might also like[Verse 2]. Dear lover. You can find me on the front lines covered. In the blood and tears of another. Brother, sister, mother. Revolutions being broadcast on Facebook and Twitter. There's a noise. I can hear it when the megaphone roars. Wipe the tears from this tear gas choice. We have a choice. Stand in front of your fear, baby, time to find your voice. . It's a story. A love story. You can believe in. Death, birth, your life's worth it's trending. It's a story. A love story. How vain are we to expect a happy ending?. I got my hands up. Follow directions still they shoot us. I'm fucking sick and tired of no justice. No peace. Promise me I'll never pick your body off the streets. We're all taking heat here. The trust is broken I don't get these police. Disenfranchised step in to a new life. Maybe if you listen to the wind there's a war cry. Peace in America. Peace in America. Be decent America. I'm begging you. [Pre-Chorus]. What I see, in you. A young tree bearing fruit. Place to start. Don't stand behind your heart. . [Chorus]. You gotta put down the weight. You gotta get out of your way. You gotta put down the weight. You gotta get out of your wayEmbed
