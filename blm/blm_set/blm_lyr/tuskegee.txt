We're ripped from the tree. Bad blood in me. A simple word. Tuskegee. . Bad blood bestowed on me. By a tyranny. Left to rot and die. Hear my bloody cry. Tuskegee. Now don't be long, you don't belong here anymore. Pack all your things and pray you're gone before the war. So don't be long, you don't belong here anymore. . Cry, dear boy, these helping hands aren't at your aid. Fly, people, I'm telling you it's been to late. Pure evil, the doctor hides a vicious smile. Upheaval, one day we shall retaliate. . Run, father, they're killing you to help themselves. Fly, mother, before long they'll want you as well. . They think they had their way and will again. But in another way we will avenge. Tuskegee.
