Oh, hey. . [Verse 1: H.E.R.]. You don't know, babe. When you hold me. You kiss me slowly. It's the sweetest thing. And it don't change. If I had it my way. You would know that you are. [Pre-Chorus: H.E.R.]. You're the coffee that I need in the morning. You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring. Won't you give yourself to me?. Give it all, oh. . [Chorus: H.E.R. & Daniel Caesar]. I just wanna see. I just wanna see how beautiful you are. You know that I see it, I know you're a star. Where you go, I'll follow, no matter how far. If life is a movie, know you're the best part, ooh. You're the best part, ooh. Best part. . [Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]. It's this sunrise. And those brown eyes, yes. You're the one that I desire. When we wake up. And then we make love (Make love). It makes me feel so nice. . [Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]. You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert. You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts. You're the sunshine on my life. You might also like[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]. I just wanna see how beautiful you are. You know that I see it, I know you're a star. Where you go, I'll follow, no matter how far. If life is a movie, then you're the best part, oh. You're the best part, ooh. Best part. . [Outro: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]. If you love me, won't you say something?. If you love me, won't you?. Won't you?. If you love me, won't you say something?. If you love me, won't you?. Love me, won't you?. If you love me, won't you say something?. If you love me, won't you?. If you love me, won't you say something?. If you love me, won't you?. Love me, won't you?.
