There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun;. Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one. But the union makes us strong. [Chorus]. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. For the union makes us strong. . [Verse 2]. It is we who plowed the prairies; built the cities where they trade;. Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid;. Now we stand outcast and starving midst the wonders we have made;. But the union makes us strong. . [Chorus]. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. For the union makes us strong. . [Verse 3]. They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn. But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn. We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn. That the union makes us strong. . [Chorus]. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. For the union makes us strong. You might also like[Verse 4]. In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold. Greater than the might of armies, magnified a thousand-fold. We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old. For the union makes us strong. . [Chorus]. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. Solidarity forever. For the union makes us strong3Embed
