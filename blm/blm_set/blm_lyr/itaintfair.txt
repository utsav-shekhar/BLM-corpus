Apartment, little food in home/. Imprisoned. In entry-level hourly positons/. Drown in repetition, hourly commission/. Spittin’ takes precedence if schedule’s concurrent/. Should sickness develop with no medical insurance, endure it/. Gas tank sign flash, state lines surpassed. Relation/. Ship survives via Facetime and Skype, I hate Vine/. My gift is rappin’ trainin’ like Bruce Wayne and Richard Dragon/. Henry Ducard tactics Lucious Fox business practices/. All I need is a mask and The League of Assassins/. Smoke screens for distractions, Nightwing on my team and I’m easily Batman/. A social-introverted hermit who moonlights’ a civil servant/. Perchin’ over ledges, thwartin’ henchmen, formin’ legends/. Takes dedication/. Brethren vacated, pain’s edification/. Never complacent, the hell is “vacation?”/. This track pillagin’ practitioner/. Craft sinister, rap lyrics to attract listeners like black ministers/. I administer wrath, feelings get/. Smashed similar to gas cylinders/. I’m iridescent in your presence, I’m so hungry it’s depressin’/. Your skeleton and flesh are like delicatessens. Blessins/. I lunch on lyricists, Devourer of Worlds/. En Sabah Nur construcin’ Pyramids. The Legend cometh/. Multi-Millennial Kemetic Hunter/. Perfected specimen, genetic wonder/. My life’s depicted in hieroglyphics/. Renaissance artists would draw my picture with European wigs and a lighter out of spite and ignorance/. As a child I was deprived as different/. Deprived of friendships, through rap albums, asylum’s givin’/. Now my concert training process’ similar to Rocky montages/. I sport mics, a darker Bob Costas/. Growin’ in gray hair/. Old enough to have kids on my own, I’m enrolling in daycare or/. Holdin’ over my shoulders while strolling through trade fairs/. Probably die alone and it ain’t fair/. But I flow like the Californian State Bear/. Lost relationships parlay into bar patronage/. Toss change at waitresses, shots chaser-less, fought pain like this/. I’m nice, cyphers get killed with kindness/. Lyrics sharper than experiments by William Stryker. How’s this for silver linin’?!/. Y’all must be ill-advised to feel that my trials can kill my drive/. If hills and mountains yield to skies, than still I rise/. This Chula Vistan with true conviction, eviction to invictus/. Writing’s on the wall, alias superstition, let’s go!/.
