Little kid in a small town. I did my best just to fit in. Broke my heart on the playground, mm. When they said I was different. . [Pre-Chorus]. Oh, now. Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed. Yeah, it's still the same. [Chorus]. It's a hard life on easy street. Just white painted picket fences far as you can see. If you think we live in the land of the free. You should try to be black like me. . [Verse 2]. My daddy worked day and night. For an old house and a used car. Just to live that good life, mm. It shouldn't be twice as hard. . [Pre-Chorus]. Oh, now. Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed. Yeah, it's still the same. . [Chorus]. It's a hard life on easy street. Just white painted picket fences far as you can see. If you think we live in the land of the free. You should try to be, oh, black like me. . [Bridge]. Oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh, I know. I'm not. The only one. Oh, yeah. Who feels. Like I. I don't belong. You might also like[Chorus]. It's a hard life on easy street. Just white painted picket fences far as you can see. And if you think we live in the land of the free. You should try to be, oh, black like me. . [Outro]. Oh, and some day we'll all be free. And I'm proud to be, oh, black like me. And I'm proud to be black like me. I'm proud to be black like me.
