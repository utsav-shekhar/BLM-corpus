Since I saw you standing there with your gun. And I can nearly remember when you looked up to me. And said, "Jack, it's all over now". I'm riding on my horse in a thirsty cell. What can I do when I don't even know. Which way I should go, well, honey the Desert Inn. Well, it's a mighty long way to go. God's favourite bandit.
