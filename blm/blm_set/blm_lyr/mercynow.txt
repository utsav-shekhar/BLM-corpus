11:11 you should make the wish to be ahead of me. It might not work cause anyone tries ends up dead to me. The flow will have Sleeping with the fishes and take yah oversea. And I don't over see. I call the shots just like a referee, Lumberjack to rappers chop em down like amputee. My rap is like trilogy, that's sequel after sequel. HUNGRY FOR THE BREAD, YOU SUPPLY THE LOAF I BE SEGUL. Got the mind of eagle that's cerebral. What you need tho. Cardiologist, you see I'm coming you yah hearts. Orthopedist, watch me as I pick these rappers Bonaparte. My flow is a work of art. Better respect my craft. It's the return Of Groovy Cat. Who always  gets the last laugh. Wear the gas mask. Cause the flow be so toxic. I'm heard in rap debates I'm the first in you're topic. Saying that I'm up next and already a top pick. The rap assassinator making yah  rappers hit the Off switch. [Chorus]. Mighty Med Mighty Med. Spit a verse and then yah dead. Shoot these rhymes like shootin bullets all I do is bust lead. Mighty Med Mighty med. Wake these rappers out they bed. Insane in the membrane make em lose they whole head. Mighty med mighty med. Should have listened when I said. They begging for my mercy and now wishing they had fled. Mighty med mighty med. Spit a verse and then yah dead. Leave em in a crucial state crying for a mighty Med. . . . . [Verse 2]. I'm on a roll like A B I'm honor Roll. Clouds coming. OH SNAP. They all running. Like they stole. Something. Get on the track. And turn nothing into something. My music be in da air. Like full speed its stays bumpin. Flow just like a treadmill. Or a Ferris wheel. I'm destined for greatness like 23. That's Quan Deal. And Realer then Holyfield. Kick these rappers high off life. Then ask em how low it feel. You acting JUST like YOU real. And acting like you the one. You think you hot. But I think you done. Watch I bust raps. Like bangers that bust guns. And leave em detrimental. Competition it's really simple. Don't try to front me. Better ask about me with the info. Somebody please point competition in my direction. So I can spit a verse so ELL. Shock like electron. I said son. I'm not a force to be reckon. Finish you off. With no thoughts of reconcile. Cold hearted and I'm wild. Don't try and toy with me. I slap you silly. Then walk of with smile. Some of you rappers are really corny. Tryna get in the limelight. But me I'd rather hear 9th Wonder say that I rhyme tight. Flows outta sight. That even go right past yah. I'm after. Weak MCs. That claims they rappers. I spit havoc. The rest spit disaster. Master of ceremonies. Not time for the silly phonies. Who claim they rap hard. Quote and quote rap stars. Who can really out rap me?. I'm talking that bar for bar. Need all the help you gon get. Better call on the shooting star. Hit the track and run laps around them all. You might also like[Bridge]. TO GO HARD. I've been feeling like. The best of the best. Bump the rest. Gas up the fuel. And I'm destined to Jet. . THE MICSTRO. I'm the one with the flow. Didn't know. That the game is a foot. I'm not the one for toe to toe. . . THE GROOVY CAT. That bust raps. That a facts. Spark a fire. Light the flame. That's a match. Where ya at. I'm apex. Predator. Give em more. You bore. And Raid up these rappers like the cops at the door. HIT THE FLOOR. . [Chorus]. Mighty Med Mighty Med. Spit a verse and then yah dead. Shoot these rhymes like shootin bullets all I do is bust lead. Mighty Med Mighty med. Wake these rappers out they bed. Insane in the membrane make em lose they whole head. Mighty med mighty med. Should have listened when I said. They begging for my mercy and now wishing they had fled. Mighty med mighty med. Spit a verse and then yah dead. Leave em in a crucial state crying for a mighty Med. . . . . [VERSE 3]. Rappers shoot they shot. But they always seem to miss. And they talk a whole lot. And try to sneak diss. It never works out. End up getting dismissed. Silly Rabbit you's a trick. They act just kids. They damsels in distress. The actress just like this. I'm out of this world. I'm AREA 51. Hit the area then they run. It's Hysterical. When I spit. They never could resist. Too lyrical that's legit. Size em' that's a perfect hit.... . . [End Verse]. And to yah favorite, he's done. Put that loud talk to sleep. Matter fact it's dead. This plan of attack has just begun. So just know when I spit you make a plan to run. Hit the deck. Cause I'm sick y'all wasting my time. Iâ€™m just tryna get away. So my chakras align. 629. While Genesis on my mind. Somebody point out the next victim for me to out rhyme. Mighty Med...Embed
