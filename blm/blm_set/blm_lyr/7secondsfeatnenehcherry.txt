Boul ma sene, boul ma guiss madi re nga fokni mane. Khamouma li neka thi sama souf ak thi guinaw. Beugouma kouma khol dal diné yaw li neka si yaw. Mo ne si man, li ne si mane moye dilene diapale. . [Verse 2: Neneh Cherry]. Roughness and rudeness we should be using. On the ones who practise wicked charms. For the sword and the stone, bad to the bone. Battle is not over, even when it's won. And when a child is born into this world. It has no concept of the tone it's skin living in. [Chorus: Neneh Cherry & Youssou N’Dour]. It's not a second—we're seven seconds away. Or just as long as I stay; I'll be waiting. It's not a second—we're seven seconds away. Or just as long as I stay; I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting...I'll be waiting. . [Verse 3: Youssou N'Dour]. J'assume les raisons qui nous poussent de changer tout. J'aimerais qu'on oublie leurs couleurs pour qu'ils espèrent. Beaucoup de sentiments de races qui font qu'ils désespèrent. Je veux les deux mains ouvertes. Des amis pour parler de leurs peines, et de leur joie. Pour qu'ils leur aient des infos qui ne divisent pas—. Changez!. . [Chorus: Neneh Cherry & Youssou N’Dour]. 7 seconds away, or just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. It's not a second–we're seven seconds away. Or just as long as I stay; I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting...I'll be waiting. . [Bridge: Neneh Cherry & Youssou N’Dour]. And when a child is born into this world. It has no concept of the tone the skin it's living in. And there's a... million voices!. And there's a... million voices. To tell you what you should be thinking. So you better sober up for just a second.

Or just as long as I stay, I'll be waiting. It's not a second; we're 7 seconds away. Just as long as I stay, I'll be waiting. It's not a second, we're 7 seconds away. Or just as long as I stay; I'll be waiting. It's not a second; we're 7 seconds away. For just as long as I stay, I'll be waiting...Embed
