There comes a time when we heed a certain call. When the world must come together as one. There are people dying. Oh, when it's time to lend a hand to life. The greatest gift of all. . [Verse 2]. We can't go on pretending day by day. That someone, somewhere will soon make a change. We are all a part of God's great big family. And the truth, you know. Love is all we need. [Chorus: Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Both]. We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day. So let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true, we'll make a better day. Just you and me. . [Verse 3]. Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares. And their lives will be stronger and free. As God has shown us by turning stone to bread. And so we all must lend a helping hand. . [Chorus]. We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day. So let's start giving. Oh, there's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true, we'll make a better day. Just you and me. . [Bridge: Michael Jackson, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper, Kim Carnes]. When you're down and out, and there seems no hope at all. But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall. Well, well, well. Let us realize, oh, that a change can only come. When we stand together as one. You might also like[Chorus: Choir]. We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day.
