Superstar, where you from, how's it goin'?. I know you got a clue what you're doin'. You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here. But I know what you are, what you are, baby. Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up. Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up. Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em. I know what you are, what you are, baby. . [Pre-Chorus]. Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer. Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby. You, y-you are, you, y-you are. Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer). [Chorus]. Boy, don't try to front, I-I know jus-just what you ar-a-are. Boy, don't try to front, I-I know jus-just what you ar-a-are. (You, you) You got me goin', you're oh-so charmin'. (You, you) But I can't do it, you womanizer. Boy, don't try to front, I-I know jus-just what you ar-a-are. Boy, don't try to front, I-I know jus-just what you ar-a-are. (You, you) You say I'm crazy, I got your crazy. (You, you) You're nothing but a womanizer. . [Verse 2]. Daddy-o, you got the swagger of a champion. Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion. I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard. It could be easy, who you are, that's just who you are, baby. Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker. To think that I would be a victim, not another. Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way. I'm never gonna fall for you, never you, baby. . [Pre-Chorus]. Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer. Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby. You, y-you are, you, y-you are (Womanizer, womanizer). Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer).
