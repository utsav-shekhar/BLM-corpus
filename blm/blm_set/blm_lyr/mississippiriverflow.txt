. NARRATOR: Hi, you're on a rock floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? Some of it's water. Fuck it, actually, most of it's water. I can't even get from here to there without buying a boat.. A plane is shown flying from South America to Africa. The plane fades off the screen, and a lone, sad stick figure is shown standing on Africa.. . NARRATOR: It's sad. I'm sad. I miss you.. . The camera pans left across the globe to show more sad stick figures also standing on South America, North America, and Europe.. . CHORUS: How did this happen?. NARRATOR: A long time ago- Actually, never, and also now, nothing is nowhere. When? Never. Makes sense, right? Like I said, it didn't happen. Nothing was never anywhere. That's why it's been everywhere. It's been so everywhere, you don't need a where. You don't even need a when. That's how "every" it gets.. A long pause happens.. . NARRATOR: Forget this. I wanna be something. Go somewhere. Do something. I want things to change. I want to invent time and space, and I know it's possible because everything is here, and it probably already happened. I just don't know when to start, and that's exactly where it started.. The sound of VCR fast forwarding plays.. . NARRATOR: Ooh, I paused it. I think there's a universe now. What's it made of?. . CHORUS: Quarks and stuff!. . NARRATOR: Ah, that's a thing, in a place. Don't like it? Try a new place, at a different time. Try to stick together because the world is gonna get bigger and emptier, but it's not empty yet. It's still very full and about a kjghpillion degrees.. . About no seconds pass.. . NARRATOR: Great news! The quarks are now happily married and in groups of three, called a proton or a neutron, and there's something else flying around too that wants to join in but can't because it's still too-. .

Like, a plant or an animal?. . The camera zooms in on a single-cell organism.. . NARRATOR: No, a microscopic speck. It lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup which is being served hot and fresh, made from gnarly space ingredients leftover from when it was raining rocks or whatever.. . The cell divides.. . NARRATOR: Oh, yeah, and it can do that.. . Those cells divide many more times.. . NARRATOR: It has secret instructions written inside itself telling it how to build another one of itself. So that's pretty nifty, I would say.. NARRATOR: Tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?. . CHORUS: Now you can eat sunlight!. . The year is now -3,000,000,000.. . NARRATOR: Using a revolutionary technique, you can convert sunlight into food.. . CHORUS: Taste the sun!. The year is now -2,300,000,000..

The year is now -200,000.. . NARRATOR: And make crazy sounds with their voice.. . CAVEMAN: Gneurshk.. . NARRATOR: Which can mean different things.. . Via the CAVEMAN's thought bubble, "Gnerushk," is shown to mean, "Hi," "Bye," and, "Can you hand me that rock over there?". . CHORUS: That's a human person!. . NARRATOR: And now they're everywhere, almost.. . Text pops on to the screen, above the landmass that is today called North America. It reads "not here yet." Humans have not migrated there yet. The year is now -20,000. Text pops on to the screen, between what is today the American state of Alaska and the Russian autonomous okrug (district) of Chukotka. The text reads "ice age." The ice age is occurring, creating a land bridge between the two landmasses.. CHORUS: Ice age!. . HUMANS: What? You can walk over here? Cool!. . The year is now -10,000.. . CHORUS: Not anymore.. . HUMANS: Well, I guess we're stuck here now.. . NARRATOR: Let's review. There's people on the planet, and they're chasing their food.. . HUMAN: Fuck it, time to plant some grass. Look at this. I control the food now. Now, everyone will want to be my friend and live near me. Let's all build houses, except mine is bigger because I own the food. This is great. I wonder if anyone else is doing this.. . The year is now -5000.. . NARRATOR: Tired of using rocks for everything? Use metal! It's underground.. .

It lists the four civilizations just named (including Mesopotamia, the "sweet dank valley right in between... two rivers"), as the counter counts up from one to four. It pauses for a moment before ticking up to five. A fifth civilization appears on the list. The camera pans right across the globe to what is modern day Peru.. CHORUS: Norte Chico!. .
