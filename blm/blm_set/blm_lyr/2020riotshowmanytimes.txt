Hmm. I just gotta get some things off my chest. Tough times, I hope y'all holdin' up. We'll be aight 'cause we always is. But I'm feelin' like this. . [Chorus]. How many mothers have to cry?. How many brothers gotta die?. How many more times?. How many more times?. How many more marches?. How many more signs?. How many more lives?. How many more times?. [Verse 1]. Take a look around, can you see it now?. Don't be colorblind, 'cause when they're killin' mine. They'll try to justify it. Oh each and every time. Playin' in a park, takin' your jog. Sittin' on the couch, in your own house. Never seem to matter what we do. You think we don't matter, but we do. You got a problem, 'cause the city on fire. But you quiet when niggas die. Let the soul up out that body that we buried. You with God now you no longer have to worry. It's so hard to sing these words out loud. All these beautiful, precious black lives. Lost in the name of senseless white pride. Tears fallin' from my eyes. . [Chorus]. How many mothers have to cry?. How many brothers gotta die?. How many more times?. How many more times?. How many more marches?. How many more signs?. How many more lives?. How many more times?. You might also like[Verse 2]. Tell me how can you be quiet?. You know the language of the unheard, is a riot. All we ever see from you is violence (True). You know you ain't no better if you silent. You talking 'bout the city on fire (Oh, oh). Where your rage when my people die?. We ain't slaves, let my people fly (Oh, yeah). Now it's time, watch my people rise. . [Chorus]. How many mothers have to cry? (Ooh, how?). How many brothers gotta die? (Ooh, how?). How many more times? (Ooh, how?). How many more times? (How many times?). How many more marches? (Ooh, how?). How many more signs? (Ooh, how?). How many more lives? (Ooh, how?). How many more times?
