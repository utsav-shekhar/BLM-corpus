You can spoon my eyes out. But I can still see through you. Slice my ears from my head. But you can not shut out the sounds of truth. Lop off each hand at the wrist. So I can't raise my fist!. . [Chorus]. You can kill the protestor (can't kill). You can't kill the protest. You can murder the rebel (murder). You can't murder the rebellion. [Verse 2]. Sawed my feet at the ankles, but I wasn't going to run. Grabbed my face, sliced off my tongue. Lock off each hand at the wrist. So I can't raise my fist!. . [Chorus]. You can kill the protestor (can't kill). You can't kill the protest. You can murder the rebel (murder). You can't murder the rebellion. . [Outro]. Lying still now, no way to speak. Nothing to fear, bullets can't silence ideas!You might also likeEmbed
