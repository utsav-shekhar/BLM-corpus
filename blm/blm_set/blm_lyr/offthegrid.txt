In the front I stand to eat so I get no back bites/. Big Jim gonna put it on like big l did/. I stay underwater with spongebob catching delicious squid/. Hit you on the radio and then turn my doorknob/. I punch beats and put fruit in my glass/. The goal was to get a bout a million in lyrical imperialism to get the finest denim’s/. I’m on a great hunt I’ll be back in 8 months/. I may show to the Emmy’s on Intergalactic trunk/. You want to pay homage I’ll make you vomit/. A plus report I’m long so I can’t be short/. In school I was deemed a dork but know I do me kick ass like Bloodsport/. Off the road I race dramatically/. Actually I’m strategizing to get wealthier and by me a yellow pit bull terrier/. I’m taking off from the weed I seen an airplane carrier/. . Chorus. . V-3. . More the merrier sharing is caring /. I had enough of rappers talk about sex and bling/. Instead I leave a quite when I sing/. No one can do everything but everyone can do something/. Brash reactions when get no cash advances/. Damn the devil on my level wins and parleys again/. Feed my ego to this noticeable sequel/. I can’t help she gonna tell it/. Wrap it up in a sub sandwich /. Her beauty mark is adorable/. Our president present behavior is deplorable/. Low income to heavily rich is crazy /. Women in the mirror she looks too hazy/. Breaking demons around me so I can tread/. Out the oven let gather my fajitas to enjoy/. Moving slow some amoebas and retarded divas/. Near the vault open it up safe wait my fault on my occult you ain’t going on pause/. . Chorus. . V-3. . Trepidation over the use of words exaggeration/. I’m going to stellar stepping to new heights/. Grazing the fields and gazing the sights/. Grading my paperwork kind of busy thinking about life bug off jerk/. Hustle hard and smart keep your circle small/. Grab my rock so I feel I’m walking tall/. Small talkers get mauled and get one of my dogs huge paws/. I’m a bourgeoise threat fucking up the set like Nathan/. Hi I can’t seem to cool down/. Making fun of me ahaha are you clowns?/. I’m at the club having a great time just being in the moment/. The toll needs to be paid that’s a large price to pay/. Bypass dying people on the side of the street uttering getting shunned and suffering/. I black and white I’m your living domino/. We pull out raps like when your tonsils gone/. This is my last creation the reaper came to dredge my life/. . ChorusEmbed
