Had a life and you wasted yours. Legal punishments aren’t enough to make you suffer for those lost. You took the shirt he’d give you off his back, what the fuck?. Do you feel full?. Do you feel right watching the innocent die?. Does it make you feel alright?. The names and thoughts will haunt you. Eliminate the scum, dispose of evil. Sick of burying the innocent six feet deep. Filled with life, now left to fill a coffin. Say his name, put meaning behind what you say. Another headline. No mercy. Eliminate the scum. Justify the wrong. No more fucking tolerance. Save the innocent. Loved ones lost at the hands of a man. Fucking vile filth. You can't take it back. All the pain you've caused left you fucked in the endYou might also likeEmbed
