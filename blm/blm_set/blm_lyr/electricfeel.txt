All along the Western front. People line up to receive. She got the power in her hands. Shock you like you won't believe. Saw her in the Amazon. Voltage running through her skin. Standing there with nothing on. She's gonna teach me how to swim. . [Chorus]. I said, "Ooh girl. Shock me like an electric eel. Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel". I said, "Ooh girl. Shock me like an electric eel. Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel". [Verse 2]. All along the Eastern shore. Put your circuits in the sea. This is what the world is for. Making electricity. But you can feel it in your mind. Oh you can do it all the time. Plug it in and change the world. You are my electric girl. . [Chorus]. I said, "Ooh girl". Shocked me like an electric eel. "Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel". I said, "Ooh girl". Shocked me like an electric eel. "Baby girl, turn me on"You might also like2Embed
