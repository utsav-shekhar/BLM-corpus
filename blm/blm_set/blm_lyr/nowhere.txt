I must be doin' it wrong. I must be doin' it wrong. I must be doin' it wrong. [Chorus]. How did I end up nowhere? Nowhere. How did I end up further back here? Back here. How did I end up nowhere? Nowhere. How did I end up further back here? Back here. . [Verse 2]. Look as the moon comes out in thе evenin'. It nevеr went back down like the sun did. How does she make it look so easy?. 'Cause I can't even get up in the mornin'. . [Pre-Chorus]. I must be doin' it wrong (I must be doin' it wrong). I must be doin' it wrong (I must be doin' it wrong). I must be doin' it. . [Chorus]. How did I end up nowhere? Nowhere. How did I end up further back here? Back here. How did I end up nowhere? Nowhere. How did I end up further back here? Back here. How did I end up nowhere? Nowhere. How did I end up further back here? Back here. How did I end up nowhere? Nowhere. How did I end up further back here? Back hereYou might also likeEmbed
