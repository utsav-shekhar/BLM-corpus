Say L, hold these keys man. What kind of wheels is those brah. (man them boys got 20's dog, Lorenzos). Man, I ain't never seen shining like that. Say H.A.W.K, what y'all use to do fool. When you was growing up. . [H.A.W.K]. I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones. Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone. From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs. Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats. Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens. Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean. Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall. Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball. Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos. Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos. Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s. Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K. Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O. Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro. Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego. Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow. [Lil Flip]. I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls. Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels. Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles. Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles. Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do. Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades. Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines. Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean. GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy. Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star. Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes. Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice. Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks. Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox. Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot. I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out. . [AP]. I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous. Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's. Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats. Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs. Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked. Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back. Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack. Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors. Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers. I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar. I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois. I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar. I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar. I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par. From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani. AP became a business man, that's all about his money. You might also like[Mista Madd]. Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore. But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again. I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado. Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos. Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado. Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah. Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds. Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm. Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini. Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini. Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors. Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators. Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies. Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me. Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET. Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what. . [Redd]. Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off. Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off. Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up. Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up. We had ice on us, merchandise on us. Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us. Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it. Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded. From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block. When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block. Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty. Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty. Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though. Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though. Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone. My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable. (*talking*)Embed
