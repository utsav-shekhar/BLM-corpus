Woah, woah. (Clibbo). Woah, woah. (D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey). . [Chorus]. Hundred band lick tonight. Pass my bro the stick tonight. Maserati whip tonight. Fuckin' on your bitch tonight. Ima take a trip tonight. Ima smoke a zip tonight. Shawty come to town and I might slide. Doing all these drugs to feel alright. (Yeah, yeah, woah, woah). [Verse]. They all see me flexing. It ain't in a Lexus. She gone leave me breathless. Touching on my necklace. She's in Stranger Things. Off DMT like eleven. I done went to Hell. But I also got to heaven. Stole her crew, that's what I do. Designer brand new racin' a Coupe. Hundreds they blue, prada my shoes. Louie on loose, neck is so icy. You might catch a flu', you talking shit. Boy you is a fool, they think I'm cool. They see me they drool, can't leave me alone. I can't go to school, everybody tell me that they love me. I don't feel it, I feel so alone. Taking drugs to numb the feeling. I thought all this money would've helped me. I was wrong even tho I'm dripping. I still wish that I was gone. . [Verse 2]. Looking at my past. Like what the fuck went wrong. You know I fucked up. If you listen to my song (Yeah). I don't got no friends. In my room is where I belong. Said the drugs are gonna kill me. Well its taking way too long. You might also like[Chorus]. Hundred band lick tonight. Pass my bro the stick tonight. Maserati whip tonight. Fuckin' on your bitch tonight. Ima take a trip tonight.
