Well I woke up this morning. And what did my eyes see?. A day of opportunity. Staring back at me. There's plenty YouTube channels. Gonna upload today. And that means. Money, money, money. Gonna take it all away. [Skit 1: UMG Employee]. Ah, time to browse my favorite creators on YouTube. Let's see who I can steal from today!. . [Verse 2]. My job here is simple. But it takes some dedication. After all, there's so much to go through. There's way too many people here. Just trying to make a living. So let's get to work. And see who we can screw. . [Chorus]. We are UMG and we are trying to make a buck. Cuz we don't already have enough to spare. If you even think about our music. We don't give a fuck. We'll take your money. And live without a care. . [Verse 3]. Just ask our friend Gus Johnson. He knows us all too well. He talked about Bohemian Rhapsody. There wasn't even music in that video to tell.
