Hello, what's wrong?. Ah nothing, no, it's stupid. You wouldn't really-. Nah you're good man, go ahead. It's just that, blue-eyed people get all of the good compliments. And I have brown eyes. I don't really get any-. . [Verse 1]. Your eyes are like dirt- (Dirt?). Hold on, I mean that as a compliment. Because dirt's the source of food and life. In every single continent. They sparkle like topaz. The stars could never parallel. They look so sweet. Like coffee filled with caramel. That's pretty sweet. And like the autumn leaves. That fall from all the trees. The colors in your eyes. Aren't as loved as they ought to be. The warmth inside of them. Matches the heart inside of me. It's like its meant to be (Wow!). [Interlude]. See, brown eyes can be beautiful too. It's all about loving truly what was given to you. But, I'm sure you want to know if I can do it. If I'm able, what would I say if they were hazel?. . [Verse 2]. Your eyes have a little bit of everything. Well, yeah, obviously. And I'd rather have a jack of all. Than a master of one. Your eyes hold true surprise. A single color's no fun. They are second to none. And they dance in the sun. And the one thing I remember. About eyes like yours. Is I can go sifting through them. Every time I'm bored. To find nuggets of gold. Like in the California rivers. If you ever need a gift. A hazel eye is going to deliver. . [Interlude]. Woah, shivers. Those eyes are winners too. It's almost like your eyes are something. Unique just to you. But I know your mind is wandering. As you become serene. What would I say if they were green?. You might also like[Verse 3]. Your eyes shine like emeralds in the light (Yeah?). They resemble lovely sights (Of?). Fireflies glowing bright. And warming up the night (Aw). An attempt to match their vibrance. Is a fail on every try. With eyes like four-leaf clovers. Know that luck is by your side. Because the odds of having eyes. With Mother Natures' favorite color. Is a feat that's so rare. You would be shocked to find another. So whenever you think green is super icky, or it sucks. Just remember that in nature. It's a healthy sign of love. . [Interlude]. See? Duh, every eye has magic. Hidden in the iris that's woven tight like fabric. Of course, you're not convinced yet. You must know what I do. What would I say if they were blue?. . [Verse 4]. Your eyes are like diamonds. That's cheesy. You're right, that's easy. And comparing to the sky or ocean waves. Would feel like cheating. Cause your eyes are so much more than that. There must be deeper meaning. 'Cause your gaze feels like a home. I could stay without ever leaving. They are calm but bold, warm but cold. With little flecks of green. And maybe little flecks of gold. They are windows to the soul. And your soul is something special. See your eyes are just a glimpse. Of the beauty inside your vessel. [Interlude]. Wow, and true beauty there is. Found outside and from beauty within. And you don't even have to ask. How I think I would react. If your eyes were so dark they looked black. . [Verse 5]. Your eyes are like the boldest of obsidian. Like the rock?. No, like the glass from a volcano. That could blow you to oblivion. It's like one in a million. Now you're basking in the glory. Your eyes are pools of ink. That could tell like a thousand stories. Your eyes aren't empty. That's far from the truth. Space looks empty too. Until you get a better view. The night is in your eyes. The universe is part of you. If only you could see yourself. How other people do. . [Interlude]. Phew, I won't lie. What a crazy journey. But it isn't finished yet. There's still a color that's yearning. So join me in this moment. There's no need for more delay. What would I say if they were grey?. . [Verse 6]. Your eyes remind me of the moon. (No way) It's true!. They're the light inside the dark. And change the tide when they're in view. The dark being the world. The tide being my mood. Your eyes blow me away. Like hurricanes and monsoons. I knew that the moment. That I met your gaze of steel. That your eyes were holding stories. That may never be revealed. They are fierce at first. And you may think that's not ideal. But I hope you come to learn. The comfort that you make others feel. . [Outro]. Hooray! I think we're finally done. A simple song for every eye. That's shining in the sun. Even after this, I'm sure. I've probably missed a few. But I hope by now we've learned. That the beauty's inside of... you!1Embed
