If you wanna come against us. You better have links to the army. A tank and a jet and a World War vet. If not, you'd be straight up barmy. Family Tree, man know what it is. We ain't inna the malarkey. You better be invincible. If you wanna harm me. . [Verse 1: Ego]. Back, I'm badder, no chain swinging. Fresh [?] and 'gnac, I'm sipping it. If man wanna come here hyping, I'll swinging. I'm way too deep for some of these dibby likkle MCs. Begging to dash, I'll liff him. Never had much back then so I went up stinging. Been on the food and singing. The rest is winning, you know me, darg. I'm way too effed, no need for a bringing. So FT, yeah, my whole team's winning. Still not part of the get along gang. So me and these MC guys ain't grinning. Nah, I don't slack, I stay on my stuff. Ain't changed one bit so you know I ain't slipping. I'm so course for the money, I swear. Seen so many get near and lose gripping. Nothing like back then, fam, keep wishing. Dem guy dere keep talking my name. But I don't fool for their [?] fishing. Got left back in '010, keep wishing. Nah, I ain't cool, I ain't tryna be friends with no one. I ain't doing this ting here to blow, son. Pagans talk smack. Till I leave their headback gone, missing. [Chorus: Merky ACE]. If you wanna come against us. You better have links to the army. A tank and a jet and a World War vet. If not, you'd be straight up barmy. Family Tree, man know what it is. We ain't inna the malarkey. You better be invincible. If you wanna harm me. . [Verse 2: TKO]. Not MMG. But like Meek Milly, I'm chasing dreams. '013, all about music creams. Tryna get funds in my Barclays. But I still wanna trap, generate them Gs. Shoebox money from them dirty fiends. Everyday I'm out here chasing the cream. Same time, tryna dodge HMP. Tryna break bread with my Family Tree. But I've got pagans tryna hate on me. You can get shelled down on your own street. If I turn that red light to green. All I wanna do is shut down raves. Turn that dirty money to clean. There ain't one better than my team. Takeover, when we drop that CD. Then man will know. No one's better than TKO. Shif or ACE. MIK and E-G-O. [?] stones and then juggling stones. Feeling hot, got a booming phone. I've got a young G that's loose with chrome. So, touch one of mine, that's two in dome. You might also like[Chorus: Merky ACE]. If you wanna come against us. You better have links to the army. A tank and a jet and a World War vet. If not, you'd be straight up barmy. Family Tree, man know what it is. We ain't inna the malarkey. You better be invincible. If you wanna harm me. . [Verse 3: Faze Miyake]. Yo, bet you never thought I would make beats. Mix them tight, then go and touch mic. Strongest team in the game. FT got man on a hype. Ain't no joke, bruv, I say what I said. When I say that, it ain't no lie. Now I do music, I've got big dreams. And none of 'em involve crime. I make quick tunes and sell 'em to DJs. Fam, that's instant play. I dropped "Take Off". Now promoters wanna put me on a plane. Girls from back in the day wanna ask how I am. Well, I can't complain. Still got no whip, riding shotty with a chick. Getting brain that drives me insane, I'm still the same. Four-eyed yout with the baitest boat. I had to go ghost. Ask anyone that I know. No Young Spray but I'm realer than most. I was burning bread before I got hot. And I don't mean toast. Fell on my face, went broke. But I'm not going back, G, that is the oath. West side flow, west coast, oh. [Chorus: Merky ACE]. If you wanna come against us. You better have links to the army. A tank and a jet and a World War vet. If not, you'd be straight up barmy. Family Tree, man know what it is. We ain't inna the malarkey. You better be invincible. If you wanna harm me. . [Verse 4: Shifman]. Look. Them man can't fuck with the team. Are you mad? Crazy? Are you off of your bean?. Man said he was a shooter, I was like "seen". You can get touched by the wickedest beam. FT, we be the wickedest team. Dem man nuh ready for the Family Tree. Nuh, dem man nuh ready for the A-C-E or E-G-O. When we come through, yeah, man better know. Catch me in the dance getting waved off Henny. Little bit of JÃ¤ger, little bit of cro. If it ain't FT then I don't know. Cuh if it ain't FT, I don't wanna know. All I know is mash up the show. When I spray big bars, oi, listen up, boom. B-double-O-M (boom). B-double-O-M (boom). Came in the game '010 (trust). Ditched couple pagans again. So next year, can't see dem man again. So RIP to a pagan friend. Didn't wanna do it how we did it back then. But they wanna try do it like we did it, set trend. I rep FT to the end. . [Chorus: Merky ACE]. If you wanna come against us. You better have links to the army. A tank and a jet and a World War vet. If not, you'd be straight up barmy. Family Tree, man know what it is. We ain't inna the malarkey. You better be invincible. If you wanna harm me. . [Verse 5: MIK]. Yo, right now you're in tune to the best MCs. In the game, that's Family Tree. Six man deep in the rave. You'd better behave or it's family beef. Some don't like it when I start talking. All that cakey stuff. But when I was a yout, I didn't have much. That's why I do it, bruv. Girls wanna DM me for the D-I-C. That's groupie love. Got a girl at home with a heart of gold. She cooks me food and stuff. Air Force Ones on my feet, they're black. With a little splash of reddish. Man wanna know why I've got so much. I said "it must be a fetish". BLT when I'm hungry, G. And I'm talking extra lettuce. We hit the B-E-double-L-Y. Real talk, my mandem are peckish. Family Tree be the best MCs in the game. It's overly bait. Been on the grind from early. And trust me when I say none of us skateEmbed
