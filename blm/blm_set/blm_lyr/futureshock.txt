Future shock. Ooh hoo. . [Verse 1]. Hey, little sister, where's your brother?. See your mother standing on the soup line. God bless your father. Ain't got the strength to be bothered. The almighty world hear me now. Was bound to weigh him down. [Chorus]. We got to stop all men. From messing up the land. When won't we understand. This is our last and only chance. Everybody, it's a future shock. Future shock, future shock. Future shock, future shock. . [Verse 2]. All worldly figures playing on niggers. Oh, see them passing. See how they're dancing to the superfly. Oh, ain't it wrong when you don't know where we come from. Dancing in our youth. Dying at the truth, to get over. (Over, over, get over). . [Chorus]. We got to stop all men. From messing up the land. When won't we understand. This is our last and only chance. Everybody, it's a future shock. Future shock, future shock. Future shock, future shock.

From messing up the land. When won't we understand. This is our last and only chance. Everybody, it's a future shock. Future shock, future shock. Future shock, future shockEmbed
