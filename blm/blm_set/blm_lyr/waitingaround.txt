Bass drum hittin' hard kickin' like an 808. Floor under my feet is shakin' like an earthquake. Strobe lights in my eyes got me seein' stars. And you gotta get me bodied baby whoever you are. Fast forward to the beat of twenty twenty four. Future sound hypnotic tearin' down the floor. East coast west cost Asia to Africa. Bumpin' in the airwaves bangin' loud and out the car. . [Chorus]. Flippers up. Everybody throw ya flippers up. Flippers up flippers up. Take em to the top. Touch down touch down take em to the ground. Touch down all the way down to the ground. Flippers up. Everybody throw ya flippers up. Flippers up flippers up. Take em to the top (throw ya flippers up). Touch down touch down take em to the ground. Touch down all the way down to the ground. [Post-Chorus]. A 7-47 is safer when it stays on the ground. But everybody knows that it was meant to fly. Meant to fly (don't be shy). Fly. Meant to fly. Why are you standin' in the corner waitin' around?. C'mon get up on the floor we rock it. Don't be shy. Don't be shy. -Shy. Don't be shy. . [Verse 2]. Everybody glistenin', shinin' in the sweat. Ain't nobody leavin' cause we ain't done yet (no). Redbull energy flowin' through my veins. Watch me get low (low low) on stage. Rewind to the sound of nineteen ninety nine. Prince singin' like it was the end of times (ooh ahh). Party like tomorrow is judgement day. Imma get it, lettin' nobody get away (get your hands up). . [Chorus]. Flippers up. Everybody throw ya flippers up. Flippers up flippers up. Take em to the top (ooh). Touch down touch down take em to the ground. Touch down all the way (take em to the ground now).

Go through the motion in slow motion. Baby it's time to slow it down (Slow it down, oh). Woo hoo. (Lemme see your hands). Go through the motion in slow motion. Do it a second time around. (Oooh ooooh. Take it on down down down down down). . [Chorus]. Touch down touch down take em to the ground. Touch down all the way down to the ground (Now watch me).
