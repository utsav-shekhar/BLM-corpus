We are the melanin felons. We are the product of. Plunder and policy that you gotta love. Casinos, amigos on forty acres, uh. They built this shit on our backs. Made an America. . Living in terror all while they terrorize. Cover your eyes 'cause people terrified. Fuck all the promises you were promised 'cause. They're cutting your oxygen 'til you paralyzed. [Chorus]. Where we land is where we fall (Made an America). All for one and none for all (Made an America). No stars dead bodies on the boulevard. Cop cars, true killers, and they still at large. Where we land is where we fall (Made an America). . [Verse 2]. Home of the big bodies and wide blocks. The government giving ghettos that crack rock. Making quotas off baking soda and mass shock. This ain't a theory, I saw it happen on my block. The homie Hector selling heroin from nine to five. My brother's burning down the block when Rodney almost died. We're giving thanks for measles, blankets, and genocide. They call it “cleaning up the streets”, we call it “homicide”. . [Chorus]. Where we land is where we fall (Made an America). All for one and none for all (Made an America). No stars dead bodies on the boulevard. Cop cars, true killers, and they still at large. Where we land is where we fall (Made an America). . [Bridge]. Made an America, we made an America. Made an America, we made an America. Made an America, we made an America. Made an America, we made an America. You might also likeAh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Alright. You built this on our backs. Okay. Show 'em who we is. . [Chorus]. Where we land is where we fall (Made an America). All for one and none for all (Made an America). No stars dead bodies on the boulevard. Cop cars, true killers, and they still at large. Where we land is where we fall (Made an America). . Made an America, we made an America. Made an America, we made an America5Embed
