Keep thinkin' that I'm seein' water. You're playing tricks on me in the sun. See your shadow in the courtyard. Stays until the day is done. The desert don't end, the rain don't fall. And I can't pretend I don't want you all. 'Cause I want you all. You all, you all, you all. . [Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]. Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you). My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper). My mind is in a free fall (Free fall). But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you. You play with my emotions (Emotions). I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean). I pray for your devotion (Devotion). 'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you. [Chorus: Sam Smith]. My oa, my oa, my oasis. My oa, my oa, my oasis. My oa, my oa, my oasis. There's nothing I can do when it comes to you. . [Verse 2: Burna Boy]. Wait a minute, tell me why you're movin' like that. Na, you wey I choose, but you make it so hard. I gave you my heart, you're makin' it so dark. But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you. You takin' it for granted. A lot of silence, the river don't end. 'Cause I want you all, yeah. You all, you all, you all. . [Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]. Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you, oh, baby). My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper). My mind is in a free fall (Free fall). But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you. You play with my emotions (Emotions). I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean). I pray for your devotion (Devotion). 'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you. You might also like[Chorus: Sam Smith]. My oa, my oa, my oasis. My oa, my oa, my oasis. My oa, my oa, my oasis. There's nothing I can do when it comes to you. My oa, my oa, my oasis. My oa, my oa, my oasis. My oa, my oa, my oasis. There's nothing I can do when it comes to you. . [Outro: Burna Boy]. I remember say me tell you. You're my all and you're my everything. And me tell you 'til it's all over. Oluwa Burna, oh11Embed
