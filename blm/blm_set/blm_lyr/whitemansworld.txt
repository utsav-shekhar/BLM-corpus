I'm a white man living in a white man's world. Under our roof is a baby girl. I thought this world could be hers one day. But her momma knew better. . [Verse 2]. I'm a white man living in a white man's town. Want to take a shot of cocaine and burn it down. Momma wants to change that Nashville sound. But they're never gonna let her. [Chorus]. There's no such thing as someone else's war. Your creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for. If you're still breathing, it's not too late. We're all carrying one big burden, sharing one fate. . [Verse 3]. I'm a white man living on a white man's street. I've got the bones of the red man under my feet. The highway runs through their burial grounds. Past the oceans of cotton. . [Verse 4]. I'm a white man looking in a black man's eyes. Wishing I'd never been one of the guys. Who pretended not to hear another white man's joke. Oh, the times ain't forgotten. . [Chorus]. There's no such thing as someone else's war. Your creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for. You're still breathing, it's not too late. We're all carrying one big burden, sharing one fate. [Instrumental bridge].
