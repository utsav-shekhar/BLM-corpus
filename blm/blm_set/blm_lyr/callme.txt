Get the fuck out. With the blasphemy. Erratically untapped I rip and thrash the leash. Attack the weak they call me Young Catastrophe. Young bastard thief. Passion for eradicating rapping beats. Emphatically attack with heat. Ripping 'till the asthma creeps. This is how a savage breathes. Rob you for your bag of weed. Ain't worried 'bout a casualty. Address me as your majesty. 'Cause ain't nobody rap like me. (Check that.). Ain't nobody rap like me. And anyone fiendin' who's seeking a beating you speak it end tragically. Beat is in pieces the reason the demons spitting fire after me. Crisp. . [2ND VERSE: THE SARGENT]. . Drop in the game. Just a pocket of change. Yeah The Sargent too flame, . And our bars aren’t the same. Ooh. Holy no Name. Bless the pen on the page. Met Bri ‘cause we went to the same school. . Now my weapons tremendous, . Collecting up pendants. Yeah, I’m decorated. Blessing a sentence. Gifting up presents. Rip to you peasants who never made it. Too busy hesitating. You like vegetation. Want some shit?. Then you better take it if it’s given to you. Speak up if you want ‘em to listen to you. Illest that spit in the booth. And I know that. Flow crack. Dope raps. Don’t hold back when I type. Fuck anybody tryn’a tell me how to write. In my own lane when I swerve by. Lines like cocaine mixed like stir fry. My hooks flame and the verse fire. See me glowin’ from my third eye. . Leave my enemies depleted. We delete ‘em. Fuck a prisoner. Best to book some ministers. The script that written sinister. Fuck y’all mother fuckers. Y’all got nothing on me. Lay you in the gutter if you fuck with the team. Funny how they ducking when I run on the scene. It’s The Sargent from the bottom. From a bum to a king. Yeah. (Sargent.). You might also like[3RD VERSE: JON BULLIS]. . Welcome to the Bullis show. Disclaimer, ain’t got no flow. But I’mma spit a couple bars. I’m here with Benjels, Bri and Sarge. Young blood. Hail from Central Mass. Couldn’t keep the gifted kid in class. Hit the state university to put in some work. But now the kids’ ‘bout to go berserk!. One more thing before this commences. I promise you I’mma keep swinging for the fences!. If y’all can leave here with just one thing. You got to understand that I’m your next king. Next in line. Visions divine. Now’s the time. Hear me rhyme!. So sublime!. Watch me shine!. . [OUTRO: SAMPLE]. . Pube industry will grow forever. (Haha.). If you don’t think that, then you’re…. Then… I… I thought…. What’s your ask?. What’s your ask?. My ask is fifty grand…. Yup. Minimal ask. Fifty grand for twenty percent of the company…Embed
