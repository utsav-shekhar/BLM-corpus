Tonight's the night that we got the truck. We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks. Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer. It's the late, late shift, no one to fear. . [Chorus]. And ride, ride, how we ride. And ride, low ride. . [Verse 2]. It's a roundup time where the good whores meet. We're gonna drag one screaming off the street. [Chorus]. And ride, ride, how we ride. . [Verse 3]. Got a black uniform and a silver badge. We're playin' cops for real, we're playin' cops for pay. . [Chorus]. Let's ride, lowride. . [Break]. . [Verse 4]. Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass. Let's beat you blue till you shit in your pants. Don't move, child, got a big black stick. There's six of us, babe, so suck on my dick!. . [Chorus]. And ride, ride, how we ride. Let's ride, low ride. . [Verse 5]. The left newspapers might whine a bit. But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit. Dispatch calls, "Are you doing something wicked?". "No siree, Jack, we're just givin' tickets!". You might also like[Chorus]. Let's ride, ride, how we ride. And ride, ride, how we ride. And ride, ride, how we ride. Let's ride, low ride2Embed
