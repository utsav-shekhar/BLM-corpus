I got more than any one woman should, I'm blessed. Have been given more than I needed, I don't deserve it. 'Cause when I'm lying in a coffin and I can't take one thing. All that really matters to be living don't mean a thing, yeah. . [Chorus]. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. [Verse 2]. I've been torn down like a worn-down crumbling building. But I'm up now, well I'm up now and I'm still living. I was chained to the pain and I couldn't feel nothing. I was waiting on somebody to come fill me with something, yeah. . [Chorus]. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. . [Bridge]. Think I reached the ceiling in my current state of being. Oh, but tryna go higher, I'm tryna go higher. Think I reached the ceiling in my current state of being. But I'm tryna go higher, I'm tryna go higher. . [Chorus]. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be real. There's got to be more to life than this. This can't be life, no, this can't be realYou might also likeEmbed
