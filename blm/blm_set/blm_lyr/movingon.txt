You call me back to tell me that you love me. I don't want you back, [?] lonely. I'm all alone, yeah, I suppose. I got nobody, no place to call a home. I got everybody telling me I'm wrong. And I don't know if I really wanna stay around. I can't get with it at all. I'm just moving, moving, moving on. Moving, moving, moving, moving on. Moving, moving, moving, moving on. Moving, moving, moving, moving on. Moving, moving, moving, moving onYou might also likeEmbed
