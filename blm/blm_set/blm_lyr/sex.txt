And I said what's up? What you been thinking?. 'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long, I swear it's come alive. And she spoke nine words and now we're sinking. But I can't find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down. . [Pre-Chorus]. 'Cause that girl took my heart. And I ain't want it back. No. I'm laying down my cards. [Verse 2]. 'Cause you said it meant nothing. And I should've kept my silence. But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know. That all these words meant nothing. And I've always been this heartless. But we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love. But love. . [Chorus]. Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings. And I don't know if this is empathy I feel. Just hold on. Remember why you said this was the last time?. . [Post-Chorus]. Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. Woah, and, so I guess it's. Woah, hey, yeah, yeah. Woah, let die to let live. . [Verse 3]. And what's good. When both choices I've got. Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?. And so I stand off like indecision's Kevlar. 'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done. But you. You might also like[Bridge]. No, I don't know how to forget you. No, I don't know how to forget you. No, I don't know how to forget you. No, I don't know how to forget you. . [Pre-Chorus]. (No, I don't know how to forget you). 'Cause that girl took my heart. (No, I don't know how to forget you). And I ain't want it back, no. (No, I don't know how to forget you). A bulletproof restart. . [Chorus]. Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings. And I don't know if this is empathy I feel. Just hold on. Remember why you said this was the last time?. . [Post-Chorus]. Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. Woah, and, so I guess it's. Woah, hey, yeah, yeah. Woah, let die to let live. [Outro]. No, I don't know how to forget you. No, I don't know how to forget you. No, I don't know how to forget you. No, I don't know how to forget you40Embed
