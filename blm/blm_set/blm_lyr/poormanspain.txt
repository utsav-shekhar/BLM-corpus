Did the crime pay more than time. Time and time, and time again?. Land of laws for the darker man. Freedom comes too slow. I could give up if my soul wasn't with me. I could give up if the blood wasn't in me. I'm pressing on, one day I'll see the sun. . [Chorus]. I'm calling out to the heart of this land. Who's gonna listen to a poor man's pain?. And I'm reaching out, reaching out again. To anyone with the will to understand. [Verse 2]. Lonely nights and longer days. Count them down but they never fade. Hard to find who I used to be. I hold tight to what's left of me. Cold are the days where the world doеsn't see me. Cold are the nights whеre nobody needs me. Won't be long, I'm coming home, ooh. . [Chorus]. I'm calling out to the heart of this land. Who's gonna listen to a poor man's pain?. And I'm reaching out, reaching out again. To anyone who will see me as I am. . [Outro]. Freedom, won't you call out my name?. Freedom, won't you call out my name?. Freedom, won't you call out my name?. I am a man just like you, ha. I bleed the blood that you do. Well, I'm a man just like you, hey. I bleed the blood that you do. Yeah, freedom, oh yeah. Oh, freedom, oh yeahYou might also likeEmbed
