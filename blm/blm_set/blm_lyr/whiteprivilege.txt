Start up my motor, eat, drink some burgers and cola. Feed my addictions and vices, oh, how my iPhone entices. My echo chamber media, regurgitated trivia. Befall the left and the right, catered for privileged whites. Signing online petitions, thinking I'm making a difference. Don't wanna hear about Brexit, them old cunts fucked up our exit. My generation was duped, the youth were left out the loop. Lies on both sides of the fence left me completely bereft. My bio reads public figure, light and full, check out my figure. Don't even know why they're famous. But God, they're so entertaining. I wanna copy what you eat, how you look, who you fuck. Wanna be anybody but me. [Refrain]. I wanna be anybody but me. I wanna be anybody but me. Wanna be anybody but me. Wanna be anybody but me. . [Verse 2]. Everybody's offended, the joke that just keeps on giving. I'm not entirely sure the nitpicking can count as progression. I'm chewing popcorn, sitting in the back row. Watching while the whole damn thing implodes. Nobody talks to each other for fear of different opinions. They call the bigots dumb for buying into fear from the papers. Smug liberal arrogance, working class don't fuck with it. It's all just ammunition for the right-wing press. The patriarchy is real, the proof is here in my song. I'll sit and mansplain every detail of the things it does wrong. 'Cause I'm a white male, full of shame. My ancestry is evil, and their evil is still not gone. . [Outro]. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not gone. Their evil is still not goneYou might also like7Embed
