Invisible, and fried. You've been looking for a life. But you've got to get high. You can't help but steal. From your family and friends. Our flames grow ignorant. And a means to an end. . Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. Rushed right through me. You must destroy yourself to get old. I've got to get one of these trees right back to me. Well, it must be the chemistry. The sexual pace of the human race. With dynamite guns and loaded runs. Look at me, I'm high on life. Until I saw it again - AHHHH!. . Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. . Well, I warned you once, and I warned you twice. And the next time I tell you ain't gonna be so nice. So you better listen up, and you better listen good. Cuz the world is crackin' up just like a broken piece of wood. You got your rats in the desert on an empty piece of land. Gonna blow each other up for what's under the sand. So you grab a little pipe, and it'll take it all away. But the world's still crackin' and nothin' gonna change. . Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. Crackin' up!. Feels good!.
