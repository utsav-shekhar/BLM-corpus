Shakara showed up to class. And she pulled out her mobile phone. It's the one thing that she owns to keep her known. She's an orphan now she just moved to a foster home. That phone keeps her connected. She's gonna keep that shit protected. The teacher said 'Get out of the class'. 'Come on can I stay'. And to his shame. He said the call's been made. I hear foot steps sounding eager. Of a cop that's about to beat her. [Pre-Chorus]. Now I am all.... . [Chorus]. I am all for the good fight. And if the cops roll by. Throw a peace sign. Say hey baby have a good night. I am all for the good fight. And if the cops roll by. Let the colors go blind. Say hey the kids. Hey hey the kids are alright. . [Verse 2]. Officer slam came and threw. Shakara backwards against the wall. I mean he flipped her just like a rag doll. And broke her arm. Tossed her across that room. Face down on the deck. He put his hands around a 16 year old girl's neck. . [Pre-Chorus]. Now I am all.... You might also like[Chorus]. I am all for the good fight. And if the cops roll by. Throw a peace sign. Say hey baby have a good night. I am all for the good fight. And if the cops roll by. Let the colors go blind. Say hey the kids. Hey hey the kids are alright. All the kids are alright. All the kids are alright. . [Bridge]. It's a lot to take in.... I'll keep it simple, here. . [Verse 3]. And on the classroom floor.... There's a little blood spatter. Why's it so hard to say Black Lives Matter. Doesn't mean that you're anti-white. Take it from me. I'm super fucking white. And on the tele. Hey that's Niya Kenny. On the Kelly File. Saying Fox News Corps is proud of you. You're the girl that stood back to a brutal attack. Come do a victory lap. Come get a clap on the back. Hey I fooled you. That never really happened. I mean come on. Could you imagine? (Ha, come on). So I take it in my hands. I talk about this shit in my rock band. And I got black fans. And got fans with sun tans. And we all have the same demands. [Pre-Chorus]. Say I am all.... . [Chorus]. I am all for the good fight. And if the cops roll by. Throw a peace sign. Say hey baby have a good night. I am all for the good fight. And if the cops roll by. Let the colors go blind. Say hey the kids. Hey hey the kids are alright (all the kids, and all the kids). All the kids are alright. All the kids are alrightEmbed
