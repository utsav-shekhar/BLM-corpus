And move mountains. . [Chorus]. And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day. I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid. I'll rise up. And I'll do it a thousand times again. And I'll rise up, high like the waves. I'll rise up in spite of the ache. I'll rise up. And I'll do it a thousand times again. [Post-Chorus]. For you. For you. For you. For you. . [Verse 2]. When the silence isn't quiet. And it feels like it's getting hard to breathe. And I know you feel like dying. But I promise we'll take the world to its feet. And move mountains. Bring it to its feet. And move mountains. .
