I won't tell you that it's gon' be ok. And I can't see the sun through all the darkened rays. I don't claim to have the answer, it's more than some can say. I won't tell you that it's gon' be ok. It might not be ok. . [Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]. Mommas been cryin' and they gon' keep cryin'. Black folk been dyin' and they gon' keep dyin'. Police been firin' and they gon' keep firin'. The government been lyin' and they gon' keep lyin'. Propaganda news channels, that shit is all for show. Camera phone videos is like all we know. Diluting what an eye witness might really say. Because the whole world saw a murder yesterday. Now your account ain't what it used to be. According to them your eyes can't adjust to the violence you ain't used to see. Police brutality is all in your mind. And the tactics that they use only look worse in rewind. And people die everyday, you should get used to it. Hands behind yo' back, face down, and still say you shootin'. Can't breathe. Knee where your neck be like why you movin'?. Kids in your car, headed home like what you doin'?. Like why you chillin'? Fuck yo' feelin's. Why you smilin' when I'm so serious?. I hate patrolling your space, like why you livin'?. Stop asking questions, why you filmin'?. You look suspicious, I think you dealin'. Step out the car, fit the description. Someone I fear, I need to kill it. Blood on the curb, I need it spillinâ€™. 'Nother civilian, 'nother not guilty. 'Nother T-shirt, 'nother rap lyric. 'Nother life gone, I can't forgive it. [Chorus: Kenneth Whalum]. I won't tell you that it's gon' be ok. And I can't see the sun through all the darkened rays. I don't claim to have the answer, it's more than some can say. I won't tell you that it's gon' be ok. It might not be okYou might also like10Embed
