Belle. The Lord and I've been friends for a mighty long time. Ooh hoo, Belle. Leaving Him has never ever really crossed my mind. Let me say just one thing. I'd never go so far, mmm. 'Cause it's Him no matter who you are, oh hoo. Belle. Oh, it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need. [Verse 2]. I'd like to take a little minute just to say now. Belle. The laughter of the sound has quieted down. Ooh hoo, mmm, Belle. The best thing we could do is have Him around. Now. I'm not playing, little lady, let me say this one thing. I think if love could abound. My heart was lost but now it's found. Ooh hoo, Belle. Oh, let's you and I let His love come down. . [Bridge]. I'm so happy, happy about that now, say this. Seems so easy to me. To try to act naturally. Let's not waste each other's time, time, ooh hoo. . [Verse 3]. Belle. He's my surprise and, Lord, he's my joy. My joy, not a toy. Belle. I know that you can understand. A little country boy. Just a little country boy. Hey, He brought me safe thus far. Let me say it, little lady. Through many drunken country bars. Ooh hoo, Belle, oh, let me say. He's my bright morning star. Belle, Belle. My bright in the morning. He's my bright in the morning, He's. He's my everything, my everything. Hey, a drink of water. (Belle, Belle). Belle. He's my joy in the morning time. (Belle, Belle). Belle. I know you're all of these things, yeah. But, uh, He's such a brighter joy, He's such a brighter. He's, He's, He's. (Little, little, little lady, Belle). (Jesus is my). (I just let you know that Jesus). Little, little, little Belle. (My everything). My everything. (Everything). Everything. In the morning. (Time, time). In the evening. (Time, time). In the daytime. In the nighttime. (Little lady). Hey! Hey!. He's my everything, yeah! He's. Belle.
