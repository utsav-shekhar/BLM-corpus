Mmm, I went away but all I did was missing you. Mmm, I was selfish but I came back to tell you. [Chorus]. I prayed every night. For someone to mend my broken heart. When I couldn't see the light. You're walking with me in the dark. And all of this time. You were right there from the start. All I ask from you is just to stay where you are. . [Verse 2]. I have been fighting all my demons away. So that I could become the best thing you have. Mmm, the only person who understands me is you. Mmm, the only life I ever wanted is with you. . [Chorus]. I prayed every night. For someone to mend my broken heart. When I couldn't see the light. You're walking with me in the dark. And all of this time. You were right there from the start. All I ask from you is just to stay where you are. . [Instrumental Break]. You might also like[Chorus]. I prayed every night. For someone to mend my broken heart. When I couldn't see the light.
