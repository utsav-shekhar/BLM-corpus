Breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. I said breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. Yes I said breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said. [Verse 1]. I hate the feeling of the pain. The constant feel of sadness. Breaking down and screaming. Crying. Giving into madness. Avid binging on teen heartbreak. Watching endless classics. I'm not PG or 13. And all my thoughts are graphic. Hand a monkey a banana. Sure as hell would grab it. I'm not angry but I'm losing hope in me a tad-bit. I'm spiraling down and starting to pickup some habits. I'm thinking that I'm happy just because I'm living lavish. Ken E will beat all you niggas to bits. Grinding and serving you to all the fish. I got a Hulu I'm doing live TV. And all of these niggas is paying for dish. Ken E 17 and got now and sounding really wack. Say that to bank when I get paid and I be counting stacks. . [Chorus]. Breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. I said breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. Yes I said breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said.

I think I just sealed your fate. Happy day, a bottom feeder. Im the fiash and you the bait. Clean my foot and shione my shoe. And while you're at it peep the bottom. It's a red. A Loubitin.

I got a Cartier ring on my pinky. Now bend over give it a kiss. I got a new 'Gatti. Took it Burbank and flexed it all over your bitch. So next I see you I'll give back to charity and leave you a humble tip. I'm winnin' the digits. I get in 5. And you niggas is buggin' my bank. I at all you chickens. A chillens' ben fried. And you niggas is buggin my tank. Stank hoes. Dank hoes. In my fucking DMs. All these dank little hoes want "D" and the Ms. They can't-. . [Chorus]. Breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. I said breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. Yes I said breathe. Take a breath. In and out. Through your chest. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said breathe. I said breathe. I saidEmbed
