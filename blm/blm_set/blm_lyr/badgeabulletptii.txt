But it is about color. May have most of them fooled. But not me motherfucker. How can the filth clean up the streets?. Fuck a blue uniform. It don't mean nothing to me. . Trained to never trust us. So where the fuck is the justice. Trigger happy lunatics walking a beat. When you won't do you what they say. Then they turn up the heat. [Chorus]. So which side are you walking on?. Which side, tell me which side?. Trained to never trust us. So where the fuck is the justice?. Which side are you walking on?. Which side, tell me which side?. Trained to never trust us. (Trust us). Fuck them. No justice. . Red hands on a white man dressed in blue. The streets are looking like Germany in '42. Stop and frisk, don't resist. I'll tell you why. They still want to see the lead fly. "Scared to death". Not scared to shoot, it's true. There ain't no such thing as time for the blue. . It's not about race. But it is about color. May have most of them fooled. But not me motherfucker. You might also like[Chorus]. So which side are you walking on?. Which side, tell me which side?. Trained to never trust us. (Trust us). So where the fuck is the justice?. Which side are you walking on?. Which side, tell me which side?. Trained to never trust us. (Trust us). Fuck them. No justice. . Break down the control. Or everybody's catching bullet holes [x2]. . Break down the control. Break down the control. . Trained to never trust us. So where the fuck is the justice? [x2]. . Fuck them. No justice [x2]. . Which side are you walking on?. Which side, tell me which side?. Which side are you walking on?. Which side, tell me which side?Embed
