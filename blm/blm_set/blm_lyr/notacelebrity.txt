Alright. . [Verse 1: Timid]. A Thug, A Thief, A Liar, A Cheat. A Provider Of Deceit But Not A Celebrity. A Killer, A Coward, A Bigoted Denier. A Fear Supplier But Not A Celebrity. A Hunter, A Stalker, Bull Talker, Gum Flapper. A Very Bad Actor, But Not A Celebrity. A Provoker, Instigator, A Police Imitator. A Crowd Agitator. Not A Celebrity. The Reason, The Fault, The Catalyst, The Cause. But Never, At All.  Not A Celebrity. A Douchebag, A Chump, A Prick, A Punk. A Dick But What? Not A Celebrity. Villainous, Infamous, Insolent, Ignorant. Impotent And Impudent But Not A Celebrity. Heartless, Not The Smartest, Nor Close To Being The Sharpest. Weakly Regarded But Not A Celebrity. [Chorus]. Not A Celebrity, Not A Celebrity. Not A Celebrity, Not A Celebrity. . The Transgressor, An Aggressor, A Vulture. A Poacher, A Predator, A Character But Not A Celebrity. A Joke, A Stooge, A Jester, A Fool. Who Needs To Be Subdued But Not A Celebrity. A Hooligan, Still Fooling Them, Headline In The News Again. Even If They Suing Him Not A Celebrity. Intolerant, Disrespectful, Unregretful, Unrepentant. In Need Of A Long Sentence But Not A Celebrity. Unjustified, Undignified, Unqualified, Just Getting By. Justly Vilified But Not A Celebrity. A Sadistic Twisted Opportunistic Misfit. Who’s Horrifically Egotistic But Not A Celebrity. A Pawn In The Middle Not Worth Spittle. Just A Little Pitiful Individual Though Not A Celebrity. A Poor Excuse For A Man With Blood On His Hands. So I’m Telling You Again, Not A Celebrity. . [Chorus]. . Just As We’re Responsible For What We Do, We Need To Be Responsible For Who And What We Celebrate. . Message!. You might also like[Chorus]Embed
