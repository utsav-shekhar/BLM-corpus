Lookin' out at life like he really doesn't give a damn. Feel the hate and anger of a punk gang banger. Mad gun slinger, better yet a worthless nigga. See the ills of life for what they are. Feel yourself pitched back from the world real far. Life is grimmer than it ever was. As your blood simmers you feel your brain buzz. People look at you like you're up to somethin'. You look right back like it ain't nuthin'. Ya don't give a fuck, life is a dream. If you die tomorrow then you won't be a fiend for the green any more. 'Cos that's what keeps ya tickin'. And that's what keeps ya stickin' if not for that ya might be chillin'. You live in a hell-hole, you wanna get out. But the only thing you're seein' is doubt. On the darkside. As you walk down the street your mind is in a frenzy. You look out at the world like everybody's your enemy. 'Cos where you come from a friendly face is a bad sign. That person's even not evil just fuckin' with your mind. So as you walk along you frown your face. Steppin' with the ghetto strut at a rhythmic pace. On a mission to nowhere, yet your walk determined. The devil's got your soul and your heart is burnin'. You couldn't give a damn about another man's life. That's how it is, you're livin' trife. You've seen enough blood spilt to fill up the Hudson. So the "peace dude" shit ain't sayin' nothin'. 'Cos you couldn't give a damn if your own mama died. But if you had a child, then you would cry. It's like the 3 9's flipped to the 666. All praise is due to the upside down crucifix. The darkside. . A day comes when you see the light. Your thoughts become clear and you're feelin' bright. You're happy like a kid again, it must be a dream. Is it a dream? So real it seems. You're on top of the world and you've reached the other side. Floatin' through the sky on the clouds you ride. You thought you'd escaped but it didn't last. 'Cos now you're addicted to the sleepin' gas. On the darksideYou might also likeEmbed
