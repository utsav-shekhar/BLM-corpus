. ATHENS: CAPUCHIN CONVENT, March. 12, 1811. [i]. . Who would not laugh, if Lawrence [1], hired to grace [ii]. His costly canvas with each flattered face,. Abused his art, till Nature, with a blush,. Saw cits grow Centaurs underneath his brush?. Or, should some limner join, for show or sale,. A Maid of Honour to a Mermaid's tail? [iii]. Or low Dubost [2]—as once the world has seen—. Degrade God's creatures in his graphic spleen?. Not all that forced politeness, which defends. Fools in their faults, could gag his grinning friends.. Believe me, Moschus, like that picture seems [iv]. The book which, sillier than a sick man's dreams,. Displays a crowd of figures incomplete,. Poetic Nightmares, without head or feet.. Poets and painters, as all artists know, [v]. May shoot a little with a lengthened bow;. We claim this mutual mercy for our task,. And grant in turn the pardon which we ask;. But make not monsters spring from gentle dams—. Birds breed not vipers, tigers nurse not lambs.. . A laboured, long Exordium, sometimes tends. (Like patriot speeches) but to paltry ends; [vi]. And nonsense in a lofty note goes down,. As Pertness passes with a legal gown: [vii]. Thus many a Bard describes in pompous strain [viii]. The clear brook babbling through the goodly plain:. The groves of Granta, and her Gothic halls,. King's Coll-Cam's stream-stained windows, and old walls:. Or, in adventurous numbers, neatly aims. To paint a rainbow, or the river Thames. [3]. . You sketch a tree, and so perhaps may shine [ix]—. But daub a shipwreck like an alehouse sign;. You plan a vase—it dwindles to a pot;. Then glide down Grub-street—fasting and forgot:. Laughed into Lethe by some quaint Review,. Whose wit is never troublesome till—true.. In fine, to whatsoever you aspire,. Let it at least be simple and entire.. The greater portion of the rhyming tribe [x]. (Give ear, my friend, for thou hast been a scribe). Are led astray by some peculiar lure. [xi]. I labour to be brief—become obscure;. One falls while following Elegance too fast;. Another soars, inflated with Bombast;. Too low a third crawls on, afraid to fly,. He spins his subject to Satiety;. Absurdly varying, he at last engraves. Fish in the woods, and boars beneath the waves! [xii]. Unless your care's exact, your judgment nice,. The flight from Folly leads but into Vice;. . None are complete, all wanting in some part,. Like certain tailors, limited in art.. For galligaskins Slowshears is your man [xiii]. But coats must claim another artisan. [4]. Now this to me, I own, seems much the same. As Vulcan's feet to bear Apollo's frame;. Or, with a fair complexion, to expose. Black eyes, black ringlets, but—a bottle nose!. Dear Authors! suit your topics to your strength,. And ponder well your subject, and its length;. . Nor lift your load, before you're quite aware. What weight your shoulders will, or will not, bear.. But lucid Order, and Wit's siren voice, [xiv]. Await the Poet, skilful in his choice;. With native Eloquence he soars along,. Grace in his thoughts, and Music in his song.. Let Judgment teach him wisely to combine. With future parts the now omitted line:. This shall the Author choose, or that reject,. Precise in style, and cautious to select;. Nor slight applause will candid pens afford. To him who furnishes a wanting word. [xv]. Then fear not, if 'tis needful, to produce. Some term unknown, or obsolete in use,. (As Pitt has furnished us a word or two, [5]. Which Lexicographers declined to do;). So you indeed, with care,—(but be content. To take this license rarely)—may invent.. New words find credit in these latter days,. If neatly grafted on a Gallic phrase; [xvi]. . What Chaucer, Spenser did, we scarce refuse. To Dryden's or to Pope's maturer Muse.. If you can add a little, say why not,. As well as William Pitt, and Walter Scott?. Since they, by force of rhyme and force of lungs, [xvii]. Enriched our Island's ill-united tongues;. 'Tis then—and shall be—lawful to present. Reform in writing, as in Parliament.. As forests shed their foliage by degrees,. So fade expressions which in season please;. . And we and ours, alas! are due to Fate,. And works and words but dwindle to a date.. Though as a Monarch nods, and Commerce calls, [xviii]. Impetuous rivers stagnate in canals;. Though swamps subdued, and marshes drained, sustain [xix]. The heavy ploughshare and the yellow grain,. And rising ports along the busy shore. Protect the vessel from old Ocean's roar,. All, all, must perish; but, surviving last,. The love of Letters half preserves the past.. . True, some decay, yet not a few revive; [xx] [6]. Though those shall sink, which now appear to thrive,. As Custom arbitrates, whose shifting sway [xxi]. Our life and language must alike obey.. The immortal wars which Gods and Angels wage,. Are they not shown in Milton's sacred page?. His strain will teach what numbers best belong. To themes celestial told in Epic song. [xxii]. The slow, sad stanza will correctly paint. The Lover's anguish, or the Friend's complaint.. . But which deserves the Laurel—Rhyme or Blank? [xxiii]. Which holds on Helicon the higher rank?. Let squabbling critics by themselves dispute. This point, as puzzling as a Chancery suit.. Satiric rhyme first sprang from selfish spleen.. You doubt—see Dryden, Pope, St. Patrick's Dean. [7]. Blank verse is now, with one consent, allied. To Tragedy, and rarely quits her side.. Though mad Almanzor [8] rhymed in Dryden's days,. No sing-song Hero rants in modern plays;. . Whilst modest Comedy her verse foregoes. For jest and 'pun' [9] in very middling prose.. Not that our Bens or Beaumonts show the worse,. Or lose one point, because they wrote in verse.. But so Thalia pleases to appear, [xxiv]. Poor Virgin! damned some twenty times a year!. Whate'er the scene, let this advice have weight:—. Adapt your language to your Hero's state.. At times Melpomene forgets to groan,. And brisk Thalia takes a serious tone;. . Nor unregarded will the act pass by. Where angry Townly [10] "lifts his voice on high.". Again, our Shakespeare limits verse to Kings,. When common prose will serve for common things;. And lively Hal resigns heroic ire, [xxv]—. To "hollaing Hotspur" [11] and his sceptred sire. [xxvi]. 'Tis not enough, ye Bards, with all your art,. To polish poems; they must touch the heart:. Where'er the scene be laid, whate'er the song,. Still let it bear the hearer's soul along;. . Command your audience or to smile or weep,. Whiche'er may please you—anything but sleep.. The Poet claims our tears; but, by his leave,. Before I shed them, let me see 'him' grieve.. If banished Romeo feigned nor sigh nor tear,. Lulled by his languor, I could sleep or sneer. [xxvii]. Sad words, no doubt, become a serious face,. And men look angry in the proper place.. At double meanings folks seem wondrous sly,. And Sentiment prescribes a pensive eye;. . For Nature formed at first the inward man,. And actors copy Nature—when they can.. She bids the beating heart with rapture bound,. Raised to the Stars, or levelled with the ground;. And for Expression's aid, 'tis said, or sung, [xxviii]. She gave our mind's interpreter—the tongue,. Who, worn with use, of late would fain dispense. (At least in theatres) with common sense;. O'erwhelm with sound the Boxes, Gallery, Pit,. And raise a laugh with anything—but Wit.. . To skilful writers it will much import,. Whence spring their scenes, from common life or Court;. Whether they seek applause by smile or tear,. To draw a Lying Valet, [12] or a Lear, [13]. A sage, or rakish youngster wild from school,. A wandering Peregrine, or plain John Bull;. All persons please when Nature's voice prevails,. Scottish or Irish, born in Wilts or Wales.. Or follow common fame, or forge a plot; [xxix]. Who cares if mimic heroes lived or not!. . One precept serves to regulate the scene:. Make it appear as if it might have been.. If some Drawcansir [14] you aspire to draw,. Present him raving, and above all law:. If female furies in your scheme are planned,. Macbeth's fierce dame is ready to your hand;. For tears and treachery, for good and evil,. Constance, King Richard, Hamlet, and the Devil!. But if a new design you dare essay,. And freely wander from the beaten way,. . True to your characters, till all be past,. Preserve consistency from first to last.. Tis hard [15] to venture where our betters fail, [xxx]. Or lend fresh interest to a twice-told tale;. And yet, perchance,'tis wiser to prefer. A hackneyed plot, than choose a new, and err;. Yet copy not too closely, but record,. More justly, thought for thought than word for word;. Nor trace your Prototype through narrow ways,. But only follow where he merits praise.. . For you, young Bard! whom luckless fate may lead [16]. To tremble on the nod of all who read,. Ere your first score of cantos Time unrolls, [xxxi]. Beware—for God's sake, don't begin like Bowles!. "Awake a louder and a loftier strain," [17]—. And pray, what follows from his boiling brain?—. He sinks to Southey's level in a trice,. Whose Epic Mountains never fail in mice!. Not so of yore awoke your mighty Sire. The tempered warblings of his master-lyre;. . Soft as the gentler breathing of the lute,. "Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit". He speaks, but, as his subject swells along,. Earth, Heaven, and Hades echo with the song."[xxxii]. Still to the "midst of things" he hastens on,. As if we witnessed all already done; [xxxiii]. Leaves on his path whatever seems too mean. To raise the subject, or adorn the scene;. Gives, as each page improves upon the sight,. Not smoke from brightness, but from darkness—light;. . And truth and fiction with such art compounds,. We know not where to fix their several bounds.. If you would please the Public, deign to hear. What soothes the many-headed monster's ear: [xxxiv]. If your heart triumph when the hands of all. Applaud in thunder at the curtain's fall,. Deserve those plaudits—study Nature's page,. And sketch the striking traits of every age;. While varying Man and varying years unfold. Life's little tale, so oft, so vainly told;. . Observe his simple childhood's dawning days,. His pranks, his prate, his playmates, and his plays:. Till time at length the mannish tyro weans,. And prurient vice outstrips his tardy teens! [xxxv]. Behold him Freshman! forced no more to groan [xxxvi]. O'er Virgil's [18] devilish verses and his own;. Prayers are too tedious, Lectures too abstruse,. He flies from Tavell's frown to "Fordham's Mews;". (Unlucky Tavell! [19] doomed to daily cares [xxxvii]. By pugilistic pupils, and by bears,). . Fines, Tutors, tasks, Conventions threat in vain,. Before hounds, hunters, and Newmarket Plain.. Rough with his elders, with his equals rash,. Civil to sharpers, prodigal of cash;. Constant to nought—save hazard and a whore, [xxxviii]. Yet cursing both—for both have made him sore:. Unread (unless since books beguile disease,. The P——x becomes his passage to Degrees);. Fooled, pillaged, dunned, he wastes his terms away, [xxxix]. And unexpelled, perhaps, retires M.A.;. . Master of Arts! as hells and clubs [20] proclaim, [xl]. Where scarce a blackleg bears a brighter name!. Launched into life, extinct his early fire,. He apes the selfish prudence of his Sire;. Marries for money, chooses friends for rank,. Buys land, and shrewdly trusts not to the Bank;. Sits in the Senate; gets a son and heir;. Sends him to Harrow—for himself was there.. Mute, though he votes, unless when called to cheer,. His son's so sharp—he'll see the dog a Peer!. . Manhood declines—Age palsies every limb;. He quits the scene—or else the scene quits him;. Scrapes wealth, o'er each departing penny grieves, [xli]. And Avarice seizes all Ambition leaves;. Counts cent per cent, and smiles, or vainly frets,. O'er hoards diminished by young Hopeful's debts;. Weighs well and wisely what to sell or buy,. Complete in all life's lessons—but to die;. Peevish and spiteful, doting, hard to please,. Commending every time, save times like these;. . Crazed, querulous, forsaken, half forgot,. Expires unwept—is buried—Let him rot!. But from the Drama let me not digress,. Nor spare my precepts, though they please you less. [xlii]. Though Woman weep, and hardest hearts are stirred, [xliii]. When what is done is rather seen than heard,. Yet many deeds preserved in History's page. Are better told than acted on the stage;. The ear sustains what shocks the timid eye,. And Horror thus subsides to Sympathy,. . True Briton all beside, I here am French—. Bloodshed 'tis surely better to retrench:. The gladiatorial gore we teach to flow. In tragic scenes disgusts though but in show;. We hate the carnage while we see the trick,. And find small sympathy in being sick.. Not on the stage the regicide Macbeth. Appals an audience with a Monarch's death; [xliv]. To gaze when sable Hubert threats to sear. Young Arthur's eyes, can ours or Nature bear?. . A haltered heroine [21] Johnson sought to slay—. We saved Irene, but half damned the play,. And (Heaven be praised!) our tolerating times. Stint Metamorphoses to Pantomimes;. And Lewis' [22] self, with all his sprites, would quake. To change Earl Osmond's negro to a snake!. Because, in scenes exciting joy or grief,. We loathe the action which exceeds belief:. And yet, God knows! what may not authors do,. Whose Postscripts prate of dyeing "heroines blue"? [23]. . Above all things, Dan Poet, if you can,. Eke out your acts, I pray, with mortal man,. Nor call a ghost, unless some cursed scrape [xlv]. Must open ten trap-doors for your escape.. Of all the monstrous things I'd fain forbid,. I loathe an Opera worse than Dennis did; [24]. Where good and evil persons, right or wrong,. Rage, love, and aught but moralise—in song.. Hail, last memorial of our foreign friends, [xlvi]. Which Gaul allows, and still Hesperia lends!. . Napoleon's edicts no embargo lay. On whores—spies—singers—wisely shipped away.. Our giant Capital, whose squares are spread [xlvii]. Where rustics earned, and now may beg, their bread,. In all iniquity is grown so nice,. It scorns amusements which are not of price.. Hence the pert shopkeeper, whose throbbing ear. Aches with orchestras which he pays to hear, [xlviii]. Whom shame, not sympathy, forbids to snore,. His anguish doubling by his own "encore;" [xlix]. . Squeezed in "Fop's Alley," [25] jostled by the beaux,. Teased with his hat, and trembling for his toes;. Scarce wrestles through the night, nor tastes of ease,. Till the dropped curtain gives a glad release:. Why this, and more, he suffers—can ye guess?—. Because it costs him dear, and makes him dress! [26]. So prosper eunuchs from Etruscan schools;. Give us but fiddlers, and they're sure of fools!. Ere scenes were played by many a reverend clerk, [l] [27]. (What harm, if David danced before the ark?) [li]. . In Christmas revels, simple country folks. Were pleased with morrice-mumm'ry and coarse jokes.. Improving years, with things no longer known,. Produced blithe Punch and merry Madame Joan,. Who still frisk on with feats so lewdly low, [lii]. 'Tis strange Benvolio [28] suffers such a show;. Suppressing peer! to whom each vice gives place, [liii]. Oaths, boxing, begging—all, save rout and race.. Farce followed Comedy, and reached her prime,. In ever-laughing Foote's fantastic time: [29]. . Mad wag! who pardoned none, nor spared the best,. And turned some very serious things to jest.. Nor Church nor State escaped his public sneers,. Arms nor the Gown—Priests—Lawyers—Volunteers:. "Alas, poor Yorick!" now for ever mute!. Whoever loves a laugh must sigh for Foote.. We smile, perforce, when histrionic scenes. Ape the swoln dialogue of Kings and Queens,. When "Crononhotonthologos must die," [30]. And Arthur struts in mimic majesty.. . Moschus! with whom once more I hope to sit, [liv]. And smile at folly, if we can't at wit;. Yes, Friend! for thee I'll quit my cynic cell,. And bear Swift's motto, "Vive la bagatelle!". Which charmed our days in each Ægean clime,. As oft at home, with revelry and rhyme.. Then may Euphrosyne, who sped the past,. Soothe thy Life's scenes, nor leave thee in the last;. But find in thine—like pagan Plato's bed, [lv] [31]. Some merry Manuscript of Mimes, when dead.. . Now to the Drama let us bend our eyes,. Where fettered by whig Walpole low she lies; [32]. Corruption foiled her, for she feared her glance;. Decorum left her for an Opera dance!. Yet Chesterfield, [33] whose polished pen inveighs. 'Gainst laughter, fought for freedom to our Plays;. Unchecked by Megrims of patrician brains,. And damning Dulness of Lord Chamberlains.. Repeal that act! again let Humour roam. Wild o'er the stage—we've time for tears at home;. . Let Archer [34] plant the horns on Sullen's brows,. And Estifania gull her "Copper" [35] spouse;. The moral's scant—but that may be excused,. Men go not to be lectured, but amused.. He whom our plays dispose to Good or Ill. Must wear a head in want of Willis' skill; [36]. Aye, but Macheath's example—psha!—no more!. It formed no thieves—the thief was formed before; [37]. And spite of puritans and Collier's curse, [lvi]. Plays make mankind no better, and no worse. [38]. . Then spare our stage, ye methodistic men!. Nor burn damned Drury if it rise again. [39]. But why to brain-scorched bigots thus appeal?. Can heavenly Mercy dwell with earthly Zeal?. For times of fire and faggot let them hope!. Times dear alike to puritan or Pope.. As pious Calvin saw Servetus blaze,. So would new sects on newer victims gaze.. E'en now the songs of Solyma begin;. Faith cants, perplexed apologist of Sin!. . While the Lord's servant chastens whom he loves,. And Simeon kicks, [40] where Baxter only "shoves."[41]. Whom Nature guides, so writes, that every dunce [lvii],. Enraptured, thinks to do the same at once;. But after inky thumbs and bitten nails [lviii],. And twenty scattered quires, the coxcomb fails.. Let Pastoral be dumb; for who can hope. To match the youthful eclogues of our Pope?. Yet his and Philips' [42] faults, of different kind,. For Art too rude, for Nature too refined, [lix]. . Instruct how hard the medium 'tis to hit. 'Twixt too much polish and too coarse a wit.. A vulgar scribbler, certes, stands disgraced. In this nice age, when all aspire to taste;. The dirty language, and the noisome jest,. Which pleased in Swift of yore, we now detest;. Proscribed not only in the world polite [lx],. But even too nasty for a City Knight!. Peace to Swift's faults! his wit hath made them pass,. Unmatched by all, save matchless Hudibras!. . Whose author is perhaps the first we meet,. Who from our couplet lopped two final feet;. Nor less in merit than the longer line,. This measure moves a favourite of the Nine.. Though at first view eight feet may seem in vain. Formed, save in Ode, to bear a serious strain [lxi],. Yet Scott has shown our wondering isle of late. This measure shrinks not from a theme of weight,. And, varied skilfully, surpasses far. Heroic rhyme, but most in Love and War,. . Whose fluctuations, tender or sublime,. Are curbed too much by long-recurring rhyme.. But many a skilful judge abhors to see,. What few admire—irregularity.. This some vouchsafe to pardon; but 'tis hard. When such a word contents a British Bard.. And must the Bard his glowing thoughts confine, [lxii]. Lest Censure hover o'er some faulty line?. Remove whate'er a critic may suspect,. To gain the paltry suffrage of "Correct"?. . Or prune the spirit of each daring phrase,. To fly from Error, not to merit Praise?. Ye, who seek finished models, never cease [lxiii],. By day and night, to read the works of Greece.. But our good Fathers never bent their brains. To heathen Greek, content with native strains.. The few who read a page, or used a pen,. Were satisfied with Chaucer and old Ben;. The jokes and numbers suited to their taste. Were quaint and careless, anything but chaste;. . Yet, whether right or wrong the ancient rules,. It will not do to call our Fathers fools!. Though you and I, who eruditely know. To separate the elegant and low,. Can also, when a hobbling line appears,. Detect with fingers—in default of ears.. In sooth I do not know, or greatly care. To learn, who our first English strollers were;. Or if, till roofs received the vagrant art,. Our Muse, like that of Thespis, kept a cart;. . But this is certain, since our Shakespeare's days,. There's pomp enough—if little else—in plays;. Nor will Melpomene ascend her Throne [lxiv]. Without high heels, white plume, and Bristol stone.. Old Comedies still meet with much applause,. Though too licentious for dramatic laws;. At least, we moderns, wisely, 'tis confest,. Curtail, or silence, the lascivious jest [lxv].. Whate'er their follies, and their faults beside,. Our enterprising Bards pass nought untried;. . Nor do they merit slight applause who choose. An English subject for an English Muse,. And leave to minds which never dare invent. French flippancy and German sentiment.. Where is that living language which could claim. Poetic more, as philosophic, fame,. If all our Bards, more patient of delay,. Would stop, like Pope, to polish by the way? [43]. Lords of the quill, whose critical assaults. O'erthrow whole quartos with their quires of faults [lxvi],. . Who soon detect, and mark where'er we fail,. And prove our marble with too nice a nail!. Democritus himself was not so bad;. He only 'thought'—but 'you' would make us—mad!. But truth to say, most rhymers rarely guard. Against that ridicule they deem so hard;. In person negligent, they wear, from sloth,. Beards of a week, and nails of annual growth;. Reside in garrets, fly from those they meet,. And walk in alleys rather than the street. 470. With little rhyme, less reason, if you please,. The name of Poet may be got with ease,. So that not tuns of helleboric juice [lxvii]. Shall ever turn your head to any use;. Write but like Wordsworth—live beside a lake,. And keep your bushy locks a year from Blake; [44]. Then print your book, once more return to town,. And boys shall hunt your Bardship up and down. [45]. Am I not wise, if such some poets' plight,. To purge in spring—like Bayes [46]—before I write?. . If this precaution softened not my bile,. I know no scribbler with a madder style;. But since (perhaps my feelings are too nice). I cannot purchase Fame at such a price,. I'll labour gratis as a grinders' wheel, [lxviii]. And, blunt myself, give edge to other's steel,. Nor write at all, unless to teach the art. To those rehearsing for the Poet's part;. From Horace show the pleasing paths of song, [lxix],. And from my own example—what is wrong.. . Though modern practice sometimes differs quite,. 'Tis just as well to think before you write;. Let every book that suits your theme be read,. So shall you trace it to the fountain-head.. He who has learned the duty which he owes. To friends and country, and to pardon foes;. Who models his deportment as may best. Accord with Brother, Sire, or Stranger-guest;. Who takes our Laws and Worship as they are,. Nor roars reform for Senate, Church, and Bar;. . In practice, rather than loud precept, wise,. Bids not his tongue, but heart, philosophize:. Such is the man the Poet should rehearse,. As joint exemplar of his life and verse.. Sometimes a sprightly wit, and tale well told,. Without much grace, or weight, or art, will hold. A longer empire o'er the public mind. Than sounding trifles, empty, though refined.. Unhappy Greece! thy sons of ancient days. The Muse may celebrate with perfect praise,. . Whose generous children narrowed not their hearts. With Commerce, given alone to Arms and Arts. [lxx]. Our boys (save those whom public schools compel. To "Long and Short" before they're taught to spell). From frugal fathers soon imbibe by rote,. "A penny saved, my lad, 's a penny got.". Babe of a city birth! from sixpence take [lxxi]. The third, how much will the remainder make?—. "A groat."—"Ah, bravo! Dick hath done the sum! [lxxii]. He'll swell my fifty thousand to a Plum." [47]. . They whose young souls receive this rust betimes,. 'Tis clear, are fit for anything but rhymes;. And Locke will tell you, that the father's right. Who hides all verses from his children's sight;. For Poets (says this Sage [48], and many more,). Make sad mechanics with their lyric lore: [lxxiii]. And Delphi now, however rich of old,. Discovers little silver, and less gold,. Because Parnassus, though a Mount divine,. Is poor as Irus, [49] or an Irish mine. [lxxiv] [50]. . Two objects always should the Poet move,. Or one or both,—to please or to improve.. Whate'er you teach, be brief, if you design. For our remembrance your didactic line;. Redundance places Memory on the rack,. For brains may be o'erloaded, like the back. [lxxv]. Fiction does best when taught to look like Truth,. And fairy fables bubble none but youth:. Expect no credit for too wondrous tales,. Since Jonas only springs alive from Whales!. . Young men with aught but Elegance dispense;. Maturer years require a little Sense.. To end at once:—that Bard for all is fit [lxxvi]. Who mingles well instruction with his wit;. For him Reviews shall smile; for him o'erflow. The patronage of Paternoster-row;. His book, with Longman's liberal aid, shall pass. (Who ne'er despises books that bring him brass);. Through three long weeks the taste of London lead,. And cross St. George's Channel and the Tweed.. . But every thing has faults, nor is't unknown. That harps and fiddles often lose their tone,. And wayward voices, at their owner's call,. With all his best endeavours, only squall;. Dogs blink their covey, flints withhold the spark,. And double-barrels (damn them!) miss their mark. [lxxvii] [51]. Where frequent beauties strike the reader's view,. We must not quarrel for a blot or two;. But pardon equally to books or men,. The slips of Human Nature, and the Pen.. . Yet if an author, spite of foe or friend,. Despises all advice too much to mend,. But ever twangs the same discordant string,. Give him no quarter, howsoe'er he sing.. Let Havard's [52] fate o'ertake him, who, for once,. Produced a play too dashing for a dunce:. At first none deemed it his; but when his name. Announced the fact—what then?—it lost its fame.. Though all deplore when Milton deigns to doze, [lxxviii]. In a long work 'tis fair to steal repose.. . As Pictures, so shall Poems be; some stand. The critic eye, and please when near at hand; [lxxix]. But others at a distance strike the sight;. This seeks the shade, but that demands the light,. Nor dreads the connoisseur's fastidious view,. But, ten times scrutinised, is ten times new.. Parnassian pilgrims! ye whom chance, or choice, [lxxx]. Hath led to listen to the Muse's voice,. Receive this counsel, and be timely wise;. Few reach the Summit which before you lies.. . Our Church and State, our Courts and Camps, concede. Reward to very moderate heads indeed!. In these plain common sense will travel far;. All are not Erskines who mislead the Bar: [lxxxi] [53]. But Poesy between the best and worst. No medium knows; you must be last or first;. For middling Poets' miserable volumes. Are damned alike by Gods, and Men, and Columns. [lxxxii]. Again, my Jeffrey—as that sound inspires, [54]. How wakes my bosom to its wonted fires!. . Fires, such as gentle Caledonians feel. When Southrons writhe upon their critic wheel,. Or mild Eclectics, [55] when some, worse than Turks,. Would rob poor Faith to decorate "Good Works.". Such are the genial feelings them canst claim—. My Falcon flies not at ignoble game.. Mightiest of all Dunedin's beasts of chase!. For thee my Pegasus would mend his pace.. Arise, my Jeffrey! or my inkless pen. Shall never blunt its edge on meaner men;. . Till thee or thine mine evil eye discerns,. "Alas! I cannot strike at wretched kernes." [56]. Inhuman Saxon! wilt thou then resign. A Muse and heart by choice so wholly thine?. Dear d—d contemner of my schoolboy songs,. Hast thou no vengeance for my Manhood's wrongs?. If unprovoked thou once could bid me bleed,. Hast thou no weapon for my daring deed?. What! not a word!—and am I then so low?. Wilt thou forbear, who never spared a foe?. . Hast thou no wrath, or wish to give it vent?. No wit for Nobles, Dunces by descent?. No jest on "minors," quibbles on a name, [57]. Nor one facetious paragraph of blame?. Is it for this on Ilion I have stood,. And thought of Homer less than Holyrood?. On shore of Euxine or Ægean sea,. My hate, untravelled, fondly turned to thee.. Ah! let me cease! in vain my bosom burns,. From Corydon unkind Alexis turns: [58]. . Thy rhymes are vain; thy Jeffrey then forego,. Nor woo that anger which he will not show.. What then?—Edina starves some lanker son,. To write an article thou canst not shun;. Some less fastidious Scotchman shall be found,. As bold in Billingsgate, though less renowned.. As if at table some discordant dish, [59]. Should shock our optics, such as frogs for fish;. As oil in lieu of butter men decry,. And poppies please not in a modern pie; [lxxxiii]. . If all such mixtures then be half a crime,. We must have Excellence to relish rhyme.. Mere roast and boiled no Epicure invites;. Thus Poetry disgusts, or else delights.. Who shoot not flying rarely touch a gun:. Will he who swims not to the river run?. And men unpractised in exchanging knocks. Must go to Jackson [60] ere they dare to box.. Whate'er the weapon, cudgel, fist, or foil,. None reach expertness without years of toil;. . But fifty dunces can, with perfect ease,. Tag twenty thousand couplets, when they please.. Why not?—shall I, thus qualified to sit. For rotten boroughs, never show my wit?. Shall I, whose fathers with the "Quorum" sate, [lxxxiv]. And lived in freedom on a fair estate;. Who left me heir, with stables, kennels, packs, [lxxxv]. To 'all' their income, and to—'twice' its tax;. Whose form and pedigree have scarce a fault,. Shall I, I say, suppress my Attic Salt?. . Thus think "the Mob of Gentlemen;" but you,. Besides all this, must have some Genius too.. Be this your sober judgment, and a rule,. And print not piping hot from Southey's school,. Who (ere another Thalaba appears),. I trust, will spare us for at least nine years.. And hark'ye, Southey! [61] pray—but don't be vexed—. Burn all your last three works—and half the next.. But why this vain advice? once published, books. Can never be recalled—from pastry-cooks! [lxxxvi]. . Though "Madoc," with "Pucelle," [62] instead of Punk,. May travel back to Quito—on a trunk! [63]. Orpheus, we learn from Ovid and Lempriere,. Led all wild beasts but Women by the ear;. And had he fiddled at the present hour,. We'd seen the Lions waltzing in the Tower; [64]. And old Amphion, such were minstrels then,. Had built St. Paul's without the aid of Wren.. Verse too was Justice, and the Bards of Greece. Did more than constables to keep the peace;. .

Dacier, Mons. de Sévigné, Boileau, and others, have left their dispute on the meaning of this sentence in a tract considerably longer than the poem of Horace. It is printed at the close of the eleventh volume of Madame de Sévigné's Letters, edited by Grouvelle, Paris, 1806. Presuming that all who can construe may venture an opinion on such subjects, particularly as so many who can't have taken the same liberty, I should have held "my farthing candle" as awkwardly as another, had not my respect for the wits of Louis 14th's Augustan "Siècle" induced me to subjoin these illustrious authorities. I therefore offer:. . firstly Boileau: "Il est difficile de trailer des sujets qui sont à la portée de tout le monde d'une maniere qui vous les rende propres, ce qui s'appelle s'approprier un sujet par le tour qu'on y donne.". . 2dly, Batteux: "Mais il est bien difficile de donner des traits propres et individuels aux etres purement possibles.". . 3dly, Dacier: "Il est difficile de traiter convenablement ces caractères que tout le monde peut inventer.". . Mr. Sévigné's opinion and translation, consisting of some thirty pages, I omit, particularly as Mr. Grouvelle observes, "La chose est bien remarquable, aucune de ces diverses interpretations ne parait être la veritable." But, by way of comfort, it seems, fifty years afterwards, "Le lumineux Dumarsais" made his appearance, to set Horace on his legs again, "dissiper tous les nuages, et concilier tous les dissentiments;" and I suppose some fifty years hence, somebody, still more luminous, will doubtless start up and demolish Dumarsais and his system on this weighty affair, as if he were no better than Ptolemy or Copernicus and comments of no more consequence than astronomical calculations. I am happy to say, "la longueur de la dissertation" of Mr. D. prevents Mr. G. from saying any more on the matter. A better poet than Boileau, and at least as good a scholar as Mr. de Sévigné, has said,. . "A little learning is a dangerous thing.". . And by the above extract, it appears that a good deal may be rendered as useless to the Proprietors.. . [Byron chose the words in question, Difficile,' etc., as a motto for the first five cantos of 'Don Juan']. . [Footnote 16: About two years ago a young man named Townsend was announced by Mr. Cumberland, in a review (since deceased) [the 'London Review'], as being engaged in an epic poem to be entitled "Armageddon." The plan and specimen promise much; but I hope neither to offend Mr. Townsend, nor his friends, by recommending to his attention the lines of Horace to which these rhymes allude. If Mr. Townsend succeeds in his undertaking, as there is reason to hope, how much will the world be indebted to Mr. Cumberland for bringing him before the public! But, till that eventful day arrives, it may be doubted whether the premature display of his plan (sublime as the ideas confessedly are) has not,—by raising expectation too high, or diminishing curiosity, by developing his argument,—rather incurred the hazard of injuring Mr. Townsend's future prospects. Mr. Cumberland (whose talents I shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my praise) and Mr. Townsend must not suppose me actuated by unworthy motives in this suggestion. I wish the author all the success he can wish himself, and shall be truly happy to see epic poetry weighed up from the bathos where it lies sunken with Southey, Cottle, Cowley (Mrs. or Abraham), Ogilvy, Wilkie, Pye, and all the "dull of past and present days." Even if he is not a 'Milton', he may be better than 'Blackmore'; if not a 'Homer', an 'Antimachus'. I should deem myself presumptuous, as a young man, in offering advice, were it not addressed to one still younger. Mr. Townsend has the greatest difficulties to encounter; but in conquering them he will find employment; in having conquered them, his reward. I know too well "the scribbler's scoff, the critic's contumely;" and I am afraid time will teach Mr. Townsend to know them better. Those who succeed, and those who do not, must bear this alike, and it is hard to say which have most of it. I trust that Mr. Townsend's share will be from 'envy'; he will soon know mankind well enough not to attribute this expression to malice. [This note was written [at Athens] before the author was apprised of Mr. Cumberland's death [in May, 1811].—'MS'. (See Byron's letter to Dallas, August 27, 1811.) The Rev. George Townsend (1788-1857) published 'Poems' in 1810, and eight books of his 'Armageddon' in 1815. They met with the fate which Byron had predicted. In later life he compiled numerous works of scriptural exegesis. He was a Canon of Durham from 1825 till his death.]]. . [Footnote 17: The first line of 'A Spirit of Discovery by Sea', by the. Rev. W. Lisle Bowles, first published in 1805.]. [Footnote 18: Harvey, the 'circulator' of the 'circulation' of the blood, used to fling away Virgil in his ecstasy of admiration and say, "the book had a devil." Now such a character as I am copying would probably fling it away also, but rather wish that "the devil had the book;" not from dislike to the poet, but a well-founded horror of hexameters. Indeed, the public school penance of "Long and Short" is enough to beget an antipathy to poetry for the residue of a man's life, and, perhaps, so far may be an advantage.]. . [Footnote 19:. .

Among his better known pieces are 'The Minor' (1760), ridiculing Whitefield and the Methodists, and 'The Mayor of Garratt' (1763), in which he played the part of Sturgeon (Byron used this piece, for an illustration in his speech on the Frame-workers Bill, February 27, 1812).

"The stage and the press, my lord, are two of our out-sentries; if we remove them, if we hoodwink them, if we throw them into fetters, the enemy may surprise us. Therefore I must now look upon the bill before us as a step for introducing arbitrary power into this kingdom.". . Lord Chesterfield's sentiments with regard to laughter are contained in an apophthegm, repeated more than once in his correspondence: "The vulgar laugh aloud, but never smile; on the contrary, people of fashion often smile, but seldom or never laugh aloud."—'Chesterfield's Letters to his Godson', Oxford, 1890, p. 27.]]. .

He attended George III. in his first attack of madness in 1788. The power of his eye on other persons is illustrated by a story related by Frederick Reynolds ('Life and Times', ii. 23), who describes how Edmund Burke quailed under his look. His son, John Willis, was entrusted with the entire charge of the king in 1811. Compare Shelley's 'Peter Bell the Third', part vi.—. . "Let him shave his head:. Where's Dr. Willis?".

It was asserted, on the other hand, by Sir John Fielding, the Bow-street magistrate, that on every run of the piece, 'The Beggar's Opera', an increased number of highwaymen were brought to his office; and so strong was his conviction, that in 1772 he remonstrated against the performance with the managers of both the houses.]. .

Charles Simeon (1758-1836) was the leader of the evangelical movement in Cambridge. The reference may be to the rigour with which he repelled a charge brought against him by Dr. Edwards, the Master of Sidney Sussex, that a sermon which he had preached in November, 1809, savoured of antinomianism. It may be noted that a friend (the Rev. W. Parish), to whom he submitted the MS. of a rejoinder to Pearson's 'Cautions, etc.', advised him to print it, "especially if you should rather keep down a lash or two which might irritate." Simeon was naturally irascible, and, in reply to a friend who had mildly reproved him for some display of temper, signed himself, in humorous penitence, "Charles proud and irritable."

[Footnote 55: To the Eclectic or Christian Reviewers I have to return thanks for the fervour of that charity which, in 1809, induced them to express a hope that a thing then published by me might lead to certain consequences, which, although natural enough, surely came but rashly from reverend lips. I refer them to their own pages, where they congratulated themselves on the prospect of a tilt between Mr. Jeffrey and myself, from which some great good was to accrue, provided one or both were knocked on the head. Having survived two years and a half those "Elegies" which they were kindly preparing to review, I have no peculiar gusto to give them "so joyful a trouble," except, indeed, "upon compulsion, Hal;" but if, as David says in 'The Rivals', it should come to "bloody sword and gun fighting," we "won't run, will we, Sir Lucius?" [Byron, writing at Athens, away from his books, misquotes 'The Rivals'. The words, "Sir Lucius, we—we—we—we won't run," are spoken by Acres, not by David.] I do not know what I had done to these Eclectic gentlemen: my works are their lawful perquisite, to be hewn in pieces like Agag, if it seem meet unto them: but why they should be in such a hurry to kill off their author, I am ignorant. "The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong:" and now, as these Christians have "smote me on one cheek," I hold them up the other; and, in return for their good wishes, give them an opportunity of repeating them. Had any other set of men expressed such sentiments, I should have smiled, and left them to the "recording angel;" but from the pharisees of Christianity decency might be expected. I can assure these brethren, that, publican and sinner as I am, I would not have treated "mine enemy's dog thus." To show them the superiority of my brotherly love, if ever the Reverend Messrs. Simeon or Ramsden should be engaged in such a conflict as that in which they requested me to fall, I hope they may escape with being "winged" only, and that Heaviside may be at hand to extract the ball.. . ["If, however, the noble Lord and the learned advocate have the courage requisite to sustain their mutual insults, we shall probably soon hear the explosions of another kind of 'paper' war, after the fashion of the ever-memorable duel which the latter is said to have fought, or seemed to fight, with 'Little' Moore. We confess there is sufficient provocation, if not in the critique, at least in the satire, to urge a 'man of honour' to defy his assailant to mortal combat, and perhaps to warrant a man of law to 'declare' war in Westminster Hall. Of this we shall no doubt hear more in due time". . ('Eclectic Review', May, 1809). Byron pretends to believe that the "Christian" Reviewers, actuated by stern zeal for piety, were making mischief in sober earnest. "Heaviside" (see last line of Byron's note) was the surgeon in attendance at the duel between Lord Falkland and Mr. A. Powell. (See 'English Bards', 1. 686, note 2.)]]. .

[Footnote 60: John Jackson (1769-1845), better known as "Gentleman" Jackson, was champion of England from 1795 to 1803. His three fights were against Fewterel (1788), George Ingleston, nicknamed "the Brewer" (1789), and Mendoza (1795). In 1803 he retired from the ring. His rooms at 13, Bond Street, became the head-quarters of the Pugilistic Club. (See Pierce Egan's 'Life in London', pp. 252-254, where the rooms are described, and a drawing of them by Cruikshank is given.) Jackson's character stood high.. . "From the highest to the lowest person in the Sporting World, his 'decision' is law.". . He was Byron's guest at Cambridge, Newstead, and Brighton; received from him many letters; and is described by him, in a note to 'Don Juan' (xi. 19), as:. . "my old friend and corporeal pastor and master."]. . [Footnote 61: Mr. Southey has lately tied another canister to his tail in 'The Curse of Kehama', maugre the neglect of 'Madoc', etc., and has in one instance had a wonderful effect. A literary friend of mine, walking out one lovely evening last summer, on the eleventh bridge of the Paddington canal, was alarmed by the cry of "one in jeopardy:" he rushed along, collected a body of Irish haymakers (supping on butter-milk in an adjacent paddock), procured three rakes, one eel-spear and a landing net, and at last ('horresco referens') pulled out—his own publisher. The unfortunate man was gone for ever, and so was a large quarto wherewith he had taken the leap, which proved, on inquiry, to have been Mr. Southey's last work. Its "alacrity of sinking" was so great, that it has never since been heard of; though some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch's pastry premises, Cornhill. Be this as it may, the coroner's inquest brought in a verdict of "'Felo de bibliopolâ'" against a "quarto unknown;" and circumstantial evidence being since strong against 'The Curse of Kehama' (of which the above words are an exact description), it will be tried by its peers next session, in Grub-street—Arthur, Alfred, Davideis, Richard Coeur de Lion, Exodus, Exodiad, Epigoniad, Calvary, Fall of Cambria, Siege of Acre, Don Roderick, and Tom Thumb the Great, are the names of the twelve jurors. The judges are Pye, Bowles, and the bell-man of St. Sepulchre's.. . The same advocates, pro and con, will be employed as are now engaged in Sir F. Burdett's celebrated cause in the Scotch courts. The public anxiously await the result, and all 'live' publishers will be subpoenaed as witnesses.—But Mr. Southey has published 'The Curse of Kehama',—an inviting title to quibblers. By the bye, it is a good deal beneath Scott and Campbell, and not much above Southey, to allow the booby Ballantyne to entitle them, in the 'Edinburgh Annual Register' (of which, by the bye, Southey is editor) "the grand poetical triumvirate of the day." But, on second thoughts, it can be no great degree of praise to be the one-eyed leaders of the blind, though they might as well keep to themselves "Scott's thirty thousand copies sold," which must sadly discomfort poor Southey's unsaleables. Poor Southey, it should seem, is the "Lepidus" of this poetical triumvirate. I am only surprised to see him in such good company.. . "Such things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,. But wonder how the devil 'he' came there.". The trio are well defined in the sixth proposition of Euclid:—. . "Because, in the triangles D B C, A C B; D B is equal to A C; and B C common to both; the two sides D B, B C, are equal to the two A C, C B, each to each, and the angle D B C is equal to the angle A C B: therefore, the base D C is equal to the base A B, and the triangle D B C (Mr. Southey) is equal to the triangle A C B, the less to the greater, which is absurd" etc.. . The editor of the 'Edinburgh Register' will find the rest of the theorem hard by his stabling; he has only to cross the river; 'tis the first turnpike t' other side 'Pons Asinorum.'[A]. .

The 'Courier' of July 16, 1811, reports in full the first stage of the case Sir F. Burdett 'v.' William Scott ('vide supra'), which was brought before Lord Meadowbank as ordinary in the outer court. Jeffrey was counsel for the pursuer, who sought to recover a sum of £5000 lent under a bond. For the defence it was alleged that the money had been entrusted for a particular purpose, namely, the maintenance of an infant. Jeffrey denied the existence of any such claim, and maintained that whatever was scandalous or calumnious in the defence was absolutely untrue. The case, which was not included in the Scottish Law Reports, was probably settled out of court. Evidently the judge held that on technical grounds an action did not lie. Burdett's enemies were not slow in turning the scandal to account. (See a contemporary pamphlet, 'Adultery and Patriotism', London, 1811.)] ]. . [Sub-Footnote A: This Latin has sorely puzzled the University of. Edinburgh. Ballantyne said it meant the "Bridge of Berwick," but. Southey claimed it as half English; Scott swore it was the "Brig o'. Stirling:" he had just passed two King James's and a dozen Douglasses. over it. At last it was decided by Jeffrey, that it meant nothing more. nor less than the "counter of Archy Constable's shop."]. [Footnote 62: Voltaire's 'Pucelle' is not quite so immaculate as Mr. Southey's 'Joan of Arc', and yet I am afraid the Frenchman has both more truth and poetry too on his side—(they rarely go together)—than our patriotic minstrel, whose first essay was in praise of a fanatical French strumpet, whose title of witch would be correct with the change of the first letter.]. .

Elizabeth Noel, daughter of Lord Wentworth, and younger sister of Byron's mother-in-law, Lady Milbanke. He was called to the bar in 1777, and in the same year was appointed a Commissioner in Bankruptcy. In 1787 he was returned M.P. for the borough of Helleston; and from 1789 to 1795 held office as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In 1795, at the instance of his chief, Lord Grenville, he vacated his post, and by way of compensation was created a baronet with a sinecure post as Knight-Marshal of the Royal Household. Thenceforth he devoted himself to literature. In 1796 he wrote the 'Birth and Triumph of Love', by way of letter-press to some elegant designs of the Princess Elizabeth. (For 'Richard the First' and the 'Exodiad', see note, p. 436.) His plays, 'Riches and Tricks for Travellers', appeared in 1810, and there were other works. In spite of Wordsworth's testimony (Wordsworth signed, but Coleridge dictated and no doubt composed, the letter: see 'Thomas Poole and His Friends', ii. 27) "to a pure and unmixed vein of native English" in 'Richard the First (Bland-Burges Papers', 1885, p. 308), Burges as a poet awaits rediscovery. His diaries, portions of which were published in 1885, are lively and instructive. He has been immortalized in Person's Macaronics—. . "Poetis nos lætamur tribus,. Pye, Petro Pindar, parvo Pybus..

The "Delia Cruscans" were people of some education, and no profession; but these Arcadians ("Arcades ambo"—bumpkins both) send out their native nonsense without the smallest alloy, and leave all the shoes and small-clothes in the parish unrepaired, to patch up Elegies on Enclosures, and Pæans to Gunpowder. Sitting on a shop-board, they describe the fields of battle, when the only blood they ever saw was shed from the finger; and an "Essay on War" is produced by the ninth part of a "poet;". .

[Footnote 70: This well-meaning gentleman has spoiled some excellent shoemakers, and been accessory to the poetical undoing of many of the industrious poor. Nathaniel Bloomfield and his brother Bobby have set all Somersetshire singing; nor has the malady confined itself to one county. Pratt too (who once was wiser) has caught the contagion of patronage, and decoyed a poor fellow named Blackett into poetry; but he died during the operation, leaving one child and two volumes of "Remains" utterly destitute. The girl, if she don't take a poetical twist, and come forth as a shoemaking Sappho, may do well; but the "tragedies" are as ricketty as if they had been the offspring of an Earl or a Seatonian prize poet. The patrons of this poor lad are certainly answerable for his end; and it ought to be an indictable offence. But this is the least they have done: for, by a refinement of barbarity, they have made the (late) man posthumously ridiculous, by printing what he would have had sense enough never to print himself. Certes these rakers of "Remains" come under the statute against "resurrection men." What does it signify whether a poor dear dead dunce is to be stuck up in Surgeons' or in Stationers' Hall? Is it so bad to unearth his bones as his blunders? Is it not better to gibbet his body on a heath, than his soul in an octavo? "We know what we are, but we know not what we may be;" and it is to be hoped we never shall know, if a man who has passed through life with a sort of éclat is to find himself a mountebank on the other side of Styx, and made, like poor Joe Blackett, the laughing-stock of purgatory. The plea of publication is to provide for the child; now, might not some of this 'Sutor ultra Crepidaitis' friends and seducers have done a decent action without inveigling Pratt into biography? And then his inscription split into so many modicums!—"To the Duchess of Somuch, the Right Hon. So-and-So, and Mrs. and Miss Somebody, these volumes are," etc. etc.—why, this is doling out the "soft milk of dedication" in gills,—there is but a quart, and he divides it among a dozen. Why, Pratt, hadst thou not a puff left? Dost thou think six families of distinction can share this in quiet? There is a child, a book, and a dedication: send the girl to her grace, the volumes to the grocer, and the dedication to the devil.. .

[Footnote 71: Lines 737-758 are not in either of the three original MSS. of 'Hints from Horace', and were probably written in the autumn of 1811. They appear among a sheet of "alterations to 'English Bards, and S. Reviewers', continued with additions" ('MSS. L.'}, drawn up for the fifth edition, and they are inserted on a separate sheet in 'MS. M.' A second sheet ('MSS. L.') of "scraps of rhyme … principally additions and corrections for 'English Bards', etc." (for the fifth edition), some of which are dated 1810, does not give the whole passage, but includes the following variants (erased) of lines 753-756:—. . (i.). . "Then let thy ponderous quarto steep and stink,. The dullest fattest weed on Lethe's brink.. Down with that volume to the depths of hell!. Oblivion seems rewarding it too well.". (ii.). . "Yet then thy quarto still may," etc.. . A "Druid" (see 'English Bards', line 741) was Byron's name for a scribbler who wrote for his living. In 'MS. M.', "scribbler" has been erased, and "Druid" substituted. It is doubtful to whom the passage, in its final shape, was intended to apply, but it is possible that the erased lines, in which "ponderous quarto" stands for "lost songs," were aimed at Southey (see 'ante', line 657, 'note' 1).]. .
