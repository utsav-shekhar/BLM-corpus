Everybody feels blue sometimes. You gotta keep your head up and keep on trying. And if you feel the urge to raise your hand. You can start a revolution, or start a band. . [Pre-Refrain]. You better sing your song and sing it loud. But you better do it here, and you better do it now. Cause this is one short life that we live. There's some people 'cause this is what my song says. [Refrain]. Don't you bring your sadness down on me. When peace is free. There's a sign up ahead, darling, waiting on me. Can't you see?. . [Verse 2]. Well I know times can get a little tough. You gotta lean on your brother, you can't give up. Forget about your problems, and forget about your pain. Raise up our glasses and forget about our hate. . [Refrain]. Don't you bring your sadness down on me. When peace is free. There's a sign up ahead, darling, waiting on me. Can't you see? Yeah. . [Bridge]. I know, I know it's not so bad. But if you want to take a stand. Yeah. . [Solo]. . [Refrain]. Don't you bring your sadness down on me. When peace is free. There's a sign up ahead, darling, waiting on me. Can't you see?.
