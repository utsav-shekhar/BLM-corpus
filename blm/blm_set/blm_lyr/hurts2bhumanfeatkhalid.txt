You're the only one that ever makes it stop. . [Chorus: P!nk]. God, it hurts to be human. Without you, I'd be losing. And someday, we'll face the music. God, it hurts to be human. [Post-Chorus: P!nk]. But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey. And you've got me, me, me, me, too. . [Verse 2: Khalid]. Like we're buckled and preparing for the crash. Like we're walking down a road of broken glass. Now if we defeat all odds and it was us against the world. You can count on me, you know I'd have your back. . [Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]. God, it hurts to be human. Without you, I'd be losing. And someday, we'll face the music. God, it hurts to be human. . [Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]. But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey. And you've got me, me, me, me, too. But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey. And you've got me, me, me, me, too. . [Bridge: P!nk, Khalid & Both]. Hope floats away. If you could spend a day in my shoes. Your mind would change. If you knew what I've gone through. We want the same (Yeah, we do). Maybe then you'd understand. How it hurts to be human, oh.
