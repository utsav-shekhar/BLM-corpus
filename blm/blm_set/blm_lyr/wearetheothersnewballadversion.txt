She lives in the air that I breathe. I can't get it out of my mind. How you were left to bleed. Was it how you dressed. Or how you act. I can't believe. How they could act so violently. Without regret. Well, we will not forget. We are the others. We are the cast-outs. We're the outsiders. But you can't hide us. We are the others. We are the cast-outs. You're not out there on your own. If you feel mistreated. Torn and cheated. You are not alone. We are the others. As simple as air in your lungs. As simple as words on your lips. And no one should take that away. No one should argue this. Now with our heads up high. We'll carry on. And carry out. That we won't let them get us down. Or wear us out. 'cause we are not alone. We are the others. We are the cast-outs. We're the outsiders. But you can't hide us. We are the others. We are the cast-outs. You're not out there on your own. If you feel mistreated. Torn and cheated. You are not alone. We are the others. Normal is not the norm. It's just a uniform. (we are the others). Forget about the norm. (we're the outsiders). Take off your uniform. (we are the others). We are all beautiful. We are the others....You might also likeEmbed
