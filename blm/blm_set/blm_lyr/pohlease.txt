As a Black person in America, When you see the police. Say a little prayer to the Shepherd, Who let Wolves guard the Sheep?. . (Chorus). Who Police the Police. (Who Police the Police). Who Police the Police. (Who Police the Police). Who Police the Police. (Who Police the them). When they get out of line ­. X2. (Post Chorus). Are they gon’ have to kill somebody To get this revolutionary started. . (Verse#1). It's been a while since the KluKlux. Looked like the KluKlux. You ain't gotta glue clues. As common as glucose. To glimpse them a blue cloak. Welcome to America. The new coke. A cola coated with a bit a codeine. Cope with or decode it. Children of the corner. Get no dosage from the club. Club full of killers. Killing Cubs just because. Color is a credible cause. To make the bird caw. Incredible cost to a mother. To get that cursed call. That's a curb stomp to her. Confidence. That's as common as condiments. That's the kind of incompetence. That'll conjure a conflict. We're at war with security. After we built the company. Yebo. You might also like(Chorus).

How many more Malcolm Littles. Shot or Behind bars. While the Malcolm in the Middle’s. Get a shot at the bar. Part of the reason why we throw so many shots at the bar Pardon my reaching, when you shot me. I was getting my wallet. Pardon my screaming. But you take too many shots in the dark. Pardon my screaming but. Talking over your Glock is impossible. This is how it sounds when your skin starts biting you This is how it feels when your skin stars eating you. This is a problem. Not a black problem. This is a problem. Not a black problem. This is a problem. Not a black problem. (Chorus). (Post Chorus). . (Outro). They don’t have to kill. They don’t, They don’t have to kill. They don’t have to kill. They don’t, They don’t have to kill. They don’t have to kill. . Eric Garner. Dontre Hamilton. John Crawford III. Michael Brown Jr. Ezell Ford. Dante Parker. Tanesha Anderson.
