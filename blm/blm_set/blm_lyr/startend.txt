You try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding. Try to forget it but it won't stop killing you. You're running out of time. Yeah, you know you can't go back. It's too late. To say it's too late. You can't take back that you said nothing. How could you do nothing?. . [Pre-Chorus]. Is this burning right?. Am I living bridges?. Can we build our past right?. Learning through future solecism. [Chorus 1]. (I've missed times) It's played out. (Been disconnected) I've moved on. (I stressed time) Get fucked up. (Forgetting timing) My new draw. (And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right. You're dead wrong ('Cause I feel like I need to crash). What are we doing?. Let's go home. There's no hope. It's all wrong. . [Bridge]. 'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong. Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down. But it keeps raining on me. And I've been looking at the sky since I was like five years old. Been looking for the stars, but it seems like they're all gone. And the fault's not ours alone. But I think it's time to go. . [Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]. It's played out. I've moved on. Get fucked up. My new draw. And it's not right. You're dead wrong. What are we doing?. Let's go home. There's no hope. It's all wrong.

To be someone, to be someone. And oh, all we've got is to try to get it right. But no one told you. That this gon' hurt, oh no. And now all I really want is to scream. Now all I really want is to scream. Now all I really want is to scream. Now all I really want is to scream. . [Verse 3]. That shit just to try and find a way to get my head down. And head out or maybe just the two of us and head now. I'm just tryna find the real now. Dream clouds, ghost ground. Real friends, dead hometown. . [Bridge]. 'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong. Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down. But it keeps raining on me. When I been looking at the sky since I was like five years old. Been looking for the stars, but it seems like they're all gone. And it breaks my heart, you know. But I think it's time to go. [Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]. It's played out. I've moved on. Get fucked up. My new draw. And it's not right. You're dead wrong. What are we doing?. Let's go home. There's no hope. It's all wrong78Embed
