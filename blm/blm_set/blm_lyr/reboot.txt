I'm on the borderline of breakdown. ’Cause you left last night. Feeling round this empty bed. I can't sleep right. You know I didn't mean it. When I said don’t come home. Won't keep you from leaving. But I can't stand you being gone. . [Pre-Chorus: TYSM & Felix Snow]. Every word you said to me is on playback. Said you were done again, why you have do that?. Is this how it ends?. Are we better off friends?. [Chorus: TYSM & Felix Snow]. And I can't go back now. Even if I wanted to turn it all around. 'Cause my judgments clouded. Tell myself you're missing out, but I doubt it. Don't have an excuse, I just miss you. Can we get a redo?. Give our love a reboot?. . [Verse 2: Felix Snow]. You're taking too long to respond to my text. Already off with someone else in head. Long gone without single regret. But I’m still here and I’m holding on. Every song reminds me of us. And how it was when we fell in love. We could better than we've ever been. Just tell me you’re down to try it all again. . [Pre-Chorus: TYSM & Felix Snow]. Every word you said to me is on playback. Said you were done again, why you have do that?. Is this how it ends?. Are we better off friends?. . [Chorus: TYSM & Felix Snow]. And I can't go back now. Even if I wanted to turn it all around. 'Cause my judgments clouded. Tell myself you're missing out, but I doubt it. Don’t have an excuse, I just miss you. Can we get a redo?. Give our love a reboot?. Can we get a redo? M-mm. You might also like[Bridge: TYSM]. What do you say. We could try again. Everything brand new. What do you say. We could make amends. It's just me and you. Can we get a redo?. Can we get a reboot?. Can we get a redo?. Can we get a reboot?. . [Chorus: TYSM & Felix Snow]. And I can't go back now. Even if I wanted to turn it all around. 'Cause my judgments clouded. Tell myself you're missing out, but I doubt it. Don't have an excuse, I just miss you. Can we get a redo?. Give our love a reboot?Embed
