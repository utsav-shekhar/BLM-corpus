Overnight, Minneapolis on fire. Protestors leaving an auto parts store in flames. Others seen looting a local Target. Tonight was a different night of protesting. . [Verse]. I walk around with confidence, plottin' on accomplishments. Plannin' somethin' radical in the cut, so anonymous. I don't fuck with my president, tried to block all Mexicans. If he hear this message, please don't send SWAT to my residence. The police keep on killin' us, hands up then they start to shoot. Bad enough I'm scared of them and afraid of my niggas too. I'm screamin', "Black is beautiful," views are probably anti-race. I can see the fear in your eyes when you look in my face. We all been on this paper chase, the only way to keep us free. All I see is red and green, money soak when my foes'll bleed. I'm pourin' up my Hennessy, fightin' with my shadow self. End up back in therapy, next to God, that's what seems to help. Got a tat' of Malcolm X, other one is young Bruce Lee. Always practice martial arts, misinformed then you need to read. The truth they always hidin' in books because they always overlooked. That's all I need to say in this verse, and now here comes the hook. [Chorus]. Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, I'm at risk. When I be talkin' to my people like this, raise my fist. I tell Trump and the office to suck a dick, bitch, I'm pissed. Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, the abyss. Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, I'm at risk. When I be talkin' to my people like this, raise my fist. I tell Trump and the office to suck a dick, bitch, I'm pissed. Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, the abyss, the abyss. . [Outro]. When is it really gon' change? When is it really gon' stop?. When is it really gon' change? When is it really gon' stop?. When is it really gon' change? When is it really gon' stop?. When is it really gon' change? When is it really gon' stop?. When is it really gon' change? When is it really gon' stop?You might also like4Embed
