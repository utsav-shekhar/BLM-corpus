I want you to put me down this fire. And get me higher. As you get high. . [Verse 2]. I want you to fix my butterflies. You think I'm fine?. I know I'm not. . [Pre-Chorus]. I know you. I know you. I know you. You know me better than you think you do. [Verse 3]. I want the sound that makes my heart rush. And makes me rumble. As you get high. . [Verse 4]. All my runs and stumbles. The path I'm riding. I'm in your head. . [Chorus x2]. As you get high. As you get high. As you get high. As you get high. . As you get high. As you get high. As you get high. As you get high. . [Pre-Chorus]. I know you. I know you. I know you. You know me better than you think you do. You might also like[Chorus]. As you get high. As you get high. As you get high. As you get high. . As you get high (Tracking down your soul just to make you mine). As you get high (Mixing all the lights running in my eyes). As you get high (I believe in the sounds pumping in my mind). As you get high (And we bounce into the music bounce into the music). . As you get high (Tracking down your soul just to make you mine). Mixing all the lights running in my eyes. As you get high (I believe in the sounds pumping in my mind). And we bounce into the music bounce into the music. . As you get high (Tracking down your soul just to make you mine). Mixing all the lights flashing in my eyes. I believe in the sounds pumping in my mind. And we bounce into the music. Bounce into the music1Embed
