. Am I crazy?. To think that all this is crazy?. Another march for a nation that's hurting. Pain pushed back like the force you’re exerting. . There's nothing to say. When people are killed daily. By cops with a hard on for violence. Mad cause I'm yelling. I'm mad cause you're silent. . Stay calm. Don't breathe or you might get beat to fucking shit. Right hand on his right hip. Thumb resting on the pistol grip. . "Do you even speak English?. Are your tattoos gang affiliated?". . No I just wanna get home. Searched my shit. Let me go. . So I'll tell you. If you ask me. If I have doubts. Trusting the police. . Look around you. Unarmed men shot in cold blood. While a kid with a dime bag. Serves more time than a rapist. . What kind of lie are we living (What kind of lie are we living). When so few (So few). Are protecting and serving. You might also likePeople protesting. Against the ones protecting. It's a fucking red flag. It's a sign of the struggles they've had. . Fuck those who kill. . Every time I see an officer behind me. I can't help but view them as an enemy. . True fear. Systematically. Time’s up. You fucking cowardsEmbed
