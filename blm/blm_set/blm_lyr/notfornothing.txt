Why does a rose need water and a whole lot of sunshine?. One more time. Why does a rose need water and a whole lot of sunshine?. Why does the night need moonlight? Tell me. Oh not for nothing, not for nothing. . [Verse 2]. Why do the wheels keep rolling? Oh. Metal down to the floor yeah, tell me. Why do we stop at a red light, oh I. Not for nothing, oh not for nothing. Freedom fighters, fighting in silence. Oh but not for nothing, no not for nothing. [Verse 3]. Why do the hands keep ticking around the clock?. Like the sand in a hourglass, so slow but so fast. Why are we born into sinning just to be born again?. Not for nothing, oh not for nothing. Oh not for nothing, oh no. Oh not for nothing, oh not for nothing. . [Verse 4]. When you see my hands up and I say I can't breathe. That's not for nothing, oh no. When my hands are up high and I say I can't breathe. It's not for nothing, it's not for nothing. Oh not for nothing, oh not for nothingYou might also likeEmbed
