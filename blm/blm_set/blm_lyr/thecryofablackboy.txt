. Reader, if you find fault with my books, and you will,. . accept my excuse: this time when they were written.. . I’m an exile, and I looked for solace, not fame,. . lest my mind became too absorbed with misfortune.. . That’s why the man in shackles, digging ditches,. still eases his hard labour with unlearned song.. . And he who bows down to the sand and mud,. . dragging a slow barge against the current, sings:. . and he who draws flexed oars to his chest, together,. . striking a rhythm with his arms, as he beats the water.. . The tired shepherd, leaning on his crook, or sitting. . on a stone, soothes his flock with the reed pipe’s tune.. . The slave girl, singing at her work, spinning the thread,. . diverts herself, and whiles away the hours of toil.. . They say that Achilles, sad, when Briseis of Lyrnesus. . was stolen, eased his cares, with the Thessalian lyre.. . Orpheus mourned the wife twice lost to him,. . as he drew the trees and harsh rocks to his singing.. The Muse helped me too, when I sailed to Pontus. . as ordered: she alone remained a friend to my flight:. . she alone was unafraid of ambush, or the blades. . of Sintian soldiers, storms, seas, and foreign shores.. . She knows too the error that misled me, when I was ruined,. . that there was guilt, but not wickedness, in my actions.. . Surely she’s good to me now because she harmed me before,. . when she was charged, with me, with a mutual crime.. . Since they were once destined to be dangerous,. . I might wish I’d never touched the Pierian rites.. . But what can I do, now? Their very power holds me,. . and, maddened, I love song, though song wounded me.. . So the strange lotus-flowers, Odysseus’s men tasted,. gave pleasure by a flavour that did harm.. . Often a lover’s aware of his own ruin, still he clings,. . chasing after the substance of his mistake.. . I too, I delight in books, though they harmed me,. . and I love the weapon that dealt my wound.. . Perhaps these studies might seem like madness,. . but the madness has a certain benefit.. . It stops the mind from always gazing at its woes,. . and makes it forget its present circumstance.. . Like a Bacchante, possessed, feeling no wound,. . while the wild howling of the Idaean rites numbs her,. . so, when my mind’s inspired, stirred by the leafy thyrsus,. . the spirit is lifted above mortal suffering.. . It feels no exile, no Scythian seashores,. . it’s not aware of the angry gods.. . As if I were drinking soporific Lethean draughts,. . so the feeling of these hostile hours is absent.. . Book TIV.I:49-107 His Love of Poetry. . So, it’s right for me to revere the goddesses, who ease my ills,. . friends of my anxious flight, Muses of Helicon,. . who now by sea and now by land, deigned to follow. . my traces, either aboard ship or on foot.. . I pray that they at least are good to me!. . Since the rest of the gods are of great Caesar’s party,. . heaping as many as evils on me, as sand on the shore,. . fishes in the sea, or the very spawn of those same fish.. . You’d sooner count spring flowers, summer wheat,. . autumn fruit, or the wintry snowflakes,. . than the ills I endured, driven through the wide world,. . a wretch who sought the left-hand Euxine shore.. . But my evil fate’s no easier since I arrived:. . misfortune has followed my track here too.. . Here too I recognise the threads spun at my birth,. . threads of a black fleece, twisted for me.. . To say nothing of ambush, or the risks to my life,. . real, but too serious for their reality to be believed,. . how wretched to be living among Bessi and Getae,. . a man who was always there on people’s lips!. . How wretched to defend my life, at gate and wall,. . scarcely protected by the strength of the place!. . I avoided harsh military contests when I was young,. . and only touched weapons with my hands in play:. . now I’m old I strap a sword to my side, a shield. . to my left arm, and place a helmet on my grey head.. . When the lookout gives the signal for a raid. . from his tower, I quickly arm myself, my hands trembling.. . The enemy, with his bow, his arrows dipped in venom,. . circles the walls fiercely on his snorting steed:. . and as a ravening wolf carries off a sheep, outside. . the fold, and drags it through the woods and fields,. . so with anyone the barbarians find in the fields,. . who hasn’t reached the protection of the gates:. . he either follows them, a captive, and accepts the chain. . round his neck, or dies by a venomous shaft.. . This is the anxious place, where I, a new colonist,. . am hidden away: ah, the lengthy days of my sentence!. . Yet still my Muse suffers me to return to poetry. . and the ancient rites, a guest despite misfortune.. . But there’s no one to recite my verses to,. . none whose ears appreciate Latin words.. . I write, and read to myself – what else should I do?. . and my writing’s safe in its own self-criticism.. . Still I often say: ‘Who’s it for, this careful labour?. . Will Sarmatians and Getae read my writings?’. . Often copious tears run down, too, as I write,. . the paper has been soaked by my weeping,. . and my heart feels the old wounds, like new,. . and the rain of sorrow trickles down my chest.. . When I think of what I am, and what I was, how fortune. . changes, from where to where my fate has carried me,. . often my hand, furiously, angered by its efforts,. . has hurled my verses into the fire, to burn.. . Since few of so many survived, see that you,. . whoever you are, read them with forgiveness.. . And you too, Rome, denied me, take them. . in good part, songs no better than my fate.. . Book TIV.II:1-74 Tiberius’s Triumph. . Savage Germany, defeated, may have already submitted,. . like the rest of the world, on bended knee, to the Caesars,. . and perhaps the high Palatine is clothed with garlands,. . and incense is crackling on the flames, staining the light,. . while dark blood spurts over the earth, from the throat. . of the bright sacrifice, struck by the axe-blow,. . the gifts promised to the temples of the benign gods,. . are being prepared for offering by both victorious Caesars,. . and by young Germanicus and Drusus, bearing that name,. . so that their house will rule the world for ever:. . and Livia, with their fine wives, Agrippina,. . and Livilla, is offering gifts, as ever, for her son’s safety,. . to the noble gods, and the women with her, and the sinless. . Vestals, who serve the pure fires in eternal virginity:. . the loyal People, and the Senate with them, rejoice,. . and the knights, among whom I recently played my small part:. . but I miss the communal joy, I’m driven far away,. . and only faint rumour travels as far as this.. . So all the people will be able to watch the triumph,. . and read the names of leaders and captured towns,. . and see the captive kings with chains round their necks,. . marching in front of the garlanded horses,. . and behold some with down-turned faces, as is fitting,. . others, still terrible, indifferent to their fate.. . Some people will ask for histories, facts and names,. . others will answer, though they know little.. . ‘He, who shines on high in Sidonian purple,. . was leader in the war: this one next in command.. . That one now who fixes his wretched gaze on the ground,. . did not look so when he was carrying weapons.. . This fierce one, with hostile eyes still burning,. . was the instigator and planned the battles.. . That traitor, who hides his face in his shaggy hair,. . trapped our men in a treacherous place.. . They say the one who follows him was their priest,. . who sacrificed captives to their gods, gifts often refused.. . These floats: lakes, mountains, all the forts and rivers,. . filled with fierce slaughter, running with blood.. . Drusus, the elder, once earned his name there,. . who was a fine son worthy of his father.. . This with broken horns badly covered with green sedge,. . is the Rhine himself discoloured with his blood.. . See even Germany is carried along with loosened hair,. . seated sorrowing at the feet of the undefeated leader.. . Offering her proud neck to the Roman axe. . she wears chains on the arms that carried weapons.’. . You’ll ride in the victory chariot, Caesar, high above,. . wearing purple for the people, according to custom,. . applauded by their clapping, all along the way,. . flowers falling everywhere to cover your route.. . Soldiers, their heads wreathed in Apollo’s laurel,. . will chant: ‘Hurrah, for the triumph’ in loud voices.. . Often you’ll see the four horses rearing at the noise. . of all the chanting, the applause, and the din.. . Then you’ll reach the citadel, and the shrines that favour. . your prayers, and you’ll offer the votive wreath to Jove.. . All this, I, the exile, will see with my mind, as I may:. . it still has a right to the place that was taken from me:. . it travels freely through immeasurable lands,. . and reaches the heavens on its swift way,. . leads my eyes into the middle of the city,. . not allowing them to lose so great a good:. . and my spirit will find a place to see the ivory car:. . and so for a short while I’ll be in my native country.. . Yet the happy people will own the true spectacle,. . the joyful crowd will be there with their leader.. . And I will enjoy the fruits in imagination only,. . and far removed, in hearing, from it all,. . and there’ll scarcely be anyone, sent so far from Italy. . to this distant world, to tell me what I long for.. . He’ll tell of a late triumph, already out of date,. . still I’ll be glad to hear of it, whenever.. . That day will come: I’ll lay aside my gloom,. . and the public fate will outweigh the private.. . Book TIV.III:1-48 To His Wife: Death Would be Better. . Ursa Major and Minor, one that guides the Greek. . the second Phoenician ships, both un-wet, since. . you see all from the heights of the northern pole,. . and never sink below the western waters,. . and your orbit, circling the celestial reaches. . stands clear of the earth it never touches,. . gaze at those walls that Remus, Ilia’s son,. . leapt across, they say, to his undoing,. . and turn your bright face upon my lady,. . and tell me if she thinks of me or no.. . Ah, why should I fear? I seek what is clearly known.. . Why should my hope be mixed with anxious dread?. . Believe in what’s as you wish, cease to doubt what’s true,. . and have firm faith in that faith that’s firm,. . and what the pole of the fixed fires cannot tell you,. . say to yourself in a voice that does not lie,. . she who’s your greatest care, thinks of you,. . having with her all she has of you, your name.. . She clings to your features as if you were there,. . and if she lives, loves you, though far away.. . So, when her weary mind broods on her just grievance,. . does soft sleep leave her caring heart?. . Do cares rise, while you touch my place in the bed,. . that does not allow you to forget me,. . does anguish come, and the night seem endless,. . do the weary bones ache in your troubled body?. . I don’t doubt these and other things occur,. . that your love shows the marks of sorrow’s pain,. . that you’re tormented no less than Andromache,. . seeing blood-stained Hector dragged by Achilles’ chariot.. . I’m not sure what prayer to speak, I can’t say. . what feelings I wish you to have in your mind.. . Are you sad? I’m troubled to be the cause of your grief:. . Not sad? I’d have you worthy of an exiled husband.. . Grieve truly for your loss, sweetest of wives,. . endure the sad season of our misfortune,. . weep for my fate: there’s a release in weeping,. . grief is worked through, and relieved by tears.. . And I wish what you had to grieve for was my death. . and not my life, that you’d been left widowed, and alone!. . This spirit, with your help, would have issued out. . into its native air, loving tears would have wet my breast,. . my eyes, staring at the familiar sky, on my last day,. . would have been closed by your fingers,. . my ashes laid to rest in my ancestors’ tomb,. . and the earth that bore me would have had my body:. . and, in short, I’d have been as sinless as I lived.. . Now my life is shamed by this punishment.. . Book TIV.III:49-84 To His Wife: He Asks For Her Help. . I’m wretched if, when they call you an exile’s wife,. . you turn your head away, and a blush comes to your cheeks!. . I’m wretched, if you think it a disgrace to be married to me!. . I’m wretched if you’re ashamed to be mine!. . Where is that time when you used to boast. . of your husband, and not hide his name?. . Where is that time – unless you don’t wish it recalled –. . when, I remember, you loved to be, and be called, mine?. . Like a true woman you were pleased with my every gift,. . and your fond love added others to the real ones.. . There were none you preferred – I seemed so great to you –. . no other man you wished for as a husband.. . Don’t be ashamed even now, that you married me:. . it should bring you grief, but never shame.. . When reckless Capaneus died, at that sudden blow,. . did you read that Evadne blushed for her husband?. . Phaethon was not abandoned by his sisters,. . because the king of the world quelled fire with fire.. . Semele was not born of some other father than Cadmus,. . because she was destroyed through her rash request.. . Don’t let the blush of shame redden your cheeks,. . because I’ve been struck by Jupiter’s fierce lightning.. . But rise, in your faithfulness, to my defence, instead,. . be the example of a noble wife to me,. . and drown a sad theme with your virtues:. . glory climbs the heights by dangerous paths.. . Who would know of Hector, if Troy had been happy?. . The road to virtue’s paved with public ills.. . Tiphys the helmsman’s art, is idle when the sea’s calm:. . Phoebus, your art of medicine is idle if men are well.. . The virtue that’s hidden and remains unknown. . in good times, appears, asserts itself, in adversity.. . My fate grants you the opportunity for fame:. . now the loyalty you bear me can lift its head.. . Use this time, in which the chance is given,. . and the widest field lies open to your glory.. . Book TIV.IV:1-42 To Messalinus: His Guilt. . O you, who are noble in ancestral titles,. . who outshine your tribe in nobility of character,. . whose mind mirrors your father’s brilliance,. . yet does not lack a brilliance of its own,. . whose wit is eloquent in your father’s tongue,. . bettered by no other in the Roman forum -. . little though I wish to do so, I address you. . with descriptions not names, forgive my praise of you.. . I’ve sinned in nothing: your known virtues betray you,. . and if what you are is revealed I’m free from blame.. . Nor does the tribute offered you by my verse. . have power to harm you, I think, with our just prince.. . The Father of the Country himself – and who is milder. . than him – tolerates being mentioned often in my verse,. . nor can he prevent it, since Caesar is the State,. . and a share of the common wealth is also mine.. . Jupiter adds his divinity to the poet’s art,. . allowing himself to be glorified by every tongue.. . So your cause is safe, given these two deities,. . of whom one’s seen to be, the other’s thought, a god.. . Though I won’t need to, I’ll accept the blame,. . since this letter of mine wasn’t prompted by you.. . And I commit no new offence in speaking to you,. . since I often spoke to you in happier days.. . Don’t fear lest my friendship with you be a crime,. . if there’s any harm its author can be blamed.. . I always honoured your father from my earliest days -. . at least don’t wish that fact to be concealed,. . and (you may remember) he approved my talent. . even more than, in my judgement, it deserved:. . he used to speak of my verse with that eloquence. . which was a part of his great nobility.. . If your house made me welcome, it was not you. . but your father before you was deceived.. . Yet, there was no deceit, believe me: and my life. . is worth defending in all its actions but the last.. . You would deny this fault too that ruined me. . is a crime, if my sequence of ill luck was known to you.. . Either fear or error harmed me, above all error.. . Ah! Let me not remember my fate:. . Let me not touch and open those wounds. . that are not yet closed: rest itself will scarcely heal them.. . Book TIV.IV:43-88 To Messalinus: His Sentence. . So I’m rightly paying the penalty, but no. . act or stratagem is connected with my sin:. . this the god knows: so my life was not taken,. . nor my possessions appropriated by another.. . Perhaps, if I live, he might end this exile. . one day when time has softened his anger.. . For now I beg him to order me to another place,. . if my prayer is not without respect and humility.. . I pray for a milder place, a little nearer home,. . and one that’s further from the savage enemy:. . and such is Augustus’s clemency, if someone. . were to petition him for me, he might grant it.. . The frozen shores of the Euxine, the ‘hospitable’, Sea. . hold me: called Axenus, ‘inhospitable’, by men of old,. . since its waters are troubled by immoderate winds,. . and there are no quiet harbours for foreign ships.. . There are tribes round it, seeking plunder and mayhem,. . and the land’s no less fearful than the hostile sea.. . Those you hear of, men delighting in human blood,. . live almost beneath the same starry sky as myself,. . and not far away from here is the dread Tauric altar. . of Diana, goddess of the bow, stained with murder.. . They say this was once the kingdom of Thoas,. . not envied by the evil, nor desired by the good.. . Here virgin Iphigenia, for whom a deer was substituted,. . cared for the offerings, of whatever nature, to her goddess.. . Later, Orestes came here, either in piety or wickedness,. . driven by the Furies, his own conscience,. . and Pylades came, his friend, an example of true love:. . and they were a single mind in two bodies.. . They were brought straight to the sad altar. . that stood, blood-stained, before the double doors.. . yet neither of them feared death, but each. . grieved for the death that came to the other.. . The priestess had already taken her place, knife drawn,. . her Greek hair bound with barbarous sacred ribbons,. . when she recognised her brother by his speech,. . and Iphigenia gave him her embrace, not his death.. . Joyfully, she carried off the statue of the goddess. . who loathed those cruel rites, to a better home.. . Such is the region, nearly the earth’s remotest,. . that men and gods shun, that’s nearest mine:. . And near my land are those murderous rites,. . if a barbarian country can be Ovid’s land.. . O let the winds, that carried Orestes home,. . fill my returning sails, and the god be appeased.. . Book TIV.V:1-34 To A Loyal Friend (Probably Cotta). . O you the foremost of my dear friends,. . who proved the sole altar for my fortunes,. . whose words of comfort revived this dying spirit,. . as the flame does at the touch of Minerva’s oil:. . you who loyally offered a safe harbour. . and a refuge to the ship blasted by lightning:. . through whose wealth I should not have wanted. . had Caesar stripped me of my inheritance,. . while force of feeling carries me on, forgetting myself,. . ah, how close I’ve come to revealing your name!. . You know it though, and, touched by desire for praise,. . wish you could say out loud: ‘I am that man.’. . If you’d allow it, I’d certainly show you honour,. . and unite your rare loyalty with fame.. . But I fear my verse of thanks might harm you,. . an untimely honouring of your name might obstruct you.. . This you can do (and it’s safe): delight in this inwardly,. . that I’ve remembered you and you’ve been loyal,. . and, as you have, bend your oars to bring me help,. . till there’s a softer breeze and the god’s appeased:. . and save a life that no one can save, unless. . he who drowned it lifts it from the Stygian depths:. . and do what is rare, devote yourself constantly. . to every act of undiminished friendship.. . So may your fortunes ever go forward,. . so may you need no help, and yet help your own:. . so may your wife equal her husband’s endless kindness,. . and your union meet with no complaints:. . and may that brother, who’s of your blood,. . always love you, with the love of Pollux for Castor:. . so may your young son be like you, and all. . recognise that he’s yours by his character:. . so may your daughter’s marriage-torch make you. . a father-in-law, and, soon, a grandfather, while you’re young.. . Book TIV.VI:1-50 Time Passing. . In time the ploughman’s ox is made obedient to the plough,. . submitting its neck to the weight of the curving yoke:. . in time the fiery horse endures the pliant bridle,. . and takes the harsh bit in its gentle mouth:. . in time the rage of African lions is subdued,. . the fierceness they had is absent from their spirit:. . the Indian elephant, obeying its master’s command,. . submits to servitude, conquered by time.. . Time makes the grapes swell on the burgeoning clusters,. . till they can barely hold the juice inside:. . time ripens the seed into white ears of wheat,. . and takes care that the fruits do not taste sour.. . It thins the ploughshare as it turns the soil,. . it wears away hard stone, and solid steel:. . it even softens fierce anger, little by little,. . it lessens sorrow, and eases the grieving heart.. . All can be lessened by time passing,. . on its silent feet, except my troubles.. . Since I lost my native land, the threshing-floor’s twice been. . smoothed for grain, the grapes twice trampled under naked feet.. . But the long space of time hasn’t granted me patience,. . and my mind still feels the emotions of recent troubles.. . Indeed old bullocks often resist the yoke, it’s true,. . and the horse that’s broken-in often fights the bit.. . My current distress is harder than before: though still. . similar in nature, it’s grown and deepened with time.. . My ills were not so well known to me as they are now:. . they weigh more heavily now I know them better.. . It’s no little thing to apply powers still fresh to them,. . and not be exhausted beforehand by time’s ills.. . The new wrestler, on the yellow sand, is stronger. . than the one whose arms are tired by long waiting.. . The unwounded gladiator, in shining armour, is better. . than the man with weapons stained by his own blood.. . A fresh built ship does well in a furious storm:. . even a little squall shatters an old one.. . I too once endured, what I now endure, more patiently:. . how my troubles have been multiplied by passing time!. . Believe me, I’m failing, and as far as I can see, given. . my bodily powers, there’s little time left for these ills.. . I’ve neither the strength nor the colour I used to have:. . I’ve barely skin enough to cover my bones.. . My body’s troubled, but my mind is worse,. . absorbed in contemplating its ills, endlessly.. . The sight of the city’s absent, my dear friends, absent,. . and my wife’s absent, none dearer to me than her.. . A mob of Scythians are present, crowds of trousered Getae:. . So what I can see, and what I can’t see, moves me.. . There’s only one hope that comforts me in all this,. . these troubles will not outlast my death.. . Book TIV.VII:1-26 Request for A Letter. . The sun has twice drawn near me, after the icy winter cold,. . and twice completed his journey, reaching Pisces.. . In all that time why hasn’t your hand. . stirred itself to write me a few lines?. . Why has your loyalty ended, while those. . with whom I had little acquaintance have written?. . Why whenever I broke the seal on some letter. . have I hoped that it contained your name?. . The gods grant that you have indeed written, often,. . though not one letter has been delivered to me.. . I hope there’s an obvious reason. I’d sooner believe. . that Medusa’s Gorgon face was wreathed in snaky hair,. . that virgin Scylla has dogs below her belly, that there’s. . a Chimaera, lioness and serpent segmented by fire,. . that there are four-hooved Centaurs, with human breasts,. . three-bodied Geryon, and triple-headed Cerberus,. . Sphinx, and Harpies, and snake-footed Giants,. . Gyas of the hundred hands, the Minotaur, half man, half bull.. . I’d rather believe all this, than that you, dearest friend,. . have changed, and abandoned your affection for me.. . There are innumerable mountains, between you and me,. . roads, and rivers, and plains and many seas.. . There are a thousand reasons why frequent letters,. . from you, should rarely reach my hands.. . But defeat those thousand reasons by writing often,. . so I’m not always making excuses for you, my friend.. . Book TIV.VIII:1-52 The Onset of Age. . My temples already take on the colour of swan’s plumage,. . and white old age is bleaching my dark hair.. . The years of frailty, and the inertia of age, already. . steal over me, and it’s hard for me to endure my weakness.. . Now’s the time when, my labour ended,. . I should be living without troubling fears,. . to indulge in the leisure my mind always enjoyed,. . and to live at ease with my studies,. . keeping a humble house with its ancient gods,. . and the fields I inherited, now lacking a master,. . growing old with my lady’s devotion, dear friends,. . and at peace in my native country.. . Youth once hoped for such a fulfilment:. . I deserved to spend my years like that.. . The gods did not see it so, who have driven me. . over earth and sea, and landed me in Sarmatia.. . Shattered boats are drawn up in dry-dock,. . in case they fall apart in deep water.. . The horse, that has won many races, grazes idly. . in the meadow, before he fails and dishonours his victories.. . When the long-serving soldier is no longer useful. . he dedicates the weapons he carried to the ancient Lares.. . Since the slowness of old age is sapping my strength. . its time now for me to receive the gladiator’s wooden sword.. . It’s time I no longer breathed foreign air,. . or quenched my parched thirst at Getic fountains,. . but retired now to the sheltered gardens I owned,. . and enjoyed the sight of men, and the city, again.. . So, with a mind unaware of what the future would bring,. . I once prayed to be able to live peacefully when old,. . The Fates were hostile, bringing ease. . to my early years, pain to the later ones.. . Now after half a century without stain,. . I’m crushed, in the harshest years of life:. . not far from the winning post, I thought I’d reached,. . my chariot has been gravely wrecked.. . In my madness, did I drive him to hostile anger,. . the most gracious man in all the world?. . Has his mercy been quenched by my wrongdoings,. . yet my life has not been forfeit, for my error?. . I must spend it far from home, under the Northern pole,. . in the land to the sinister left of the Euxine Sea.. . If Dodona or Delphi itself had proclaimed it to me,. . both oracles would have seemed unbelievable.. . Nothing is strong enough, though bound with steel,. . to stand firm against Jove’s swift lightning:. . nothing’s so high and reaches so far beyond danger,. . that it’s not inferior, and subject, to a god.. . And though I brought a part of my trouble on myself,. . by my sin, I suffered more from the divine power’s wrath.. . Be warned by my fate, too, to make yourselves worthy. . of that man who deserves to be equal to the gods.. . Book TIV.IX:1-32 To An Enemy. . If it’s right and you allow me, I’ll keep your name. . and what you did quiet, consign the act to Lethe’s waters,. . and my clemency will be won by your late tears,. . if only you clearly have repented: if only. . you condemn yourself, and are eager to erase. . that moment of Tisiphonean madness from your life.. . If not, if your heart still burns with hatred for me,. . barren indignation will be driven to use its weapons.. . If I’m banished, as I am, to the edge of the earth,. . my anger will still reach out to you from here.. . If you don’t know it, Caesar has left me all my rights,. . and my only punishment is to lose my country.. . My country: I even hope for that from him, if he lives:. . the oak blasted by Jove’s lightning often grows green again.. . And if I’ve no chance for revenge, in the end,. . the Muses will grant me strength and their weapons.. . Though I live far away on the shores of Scythia,. . with those stars visible that never touch the sea,. . my cry will go out to countless peoples,. . my complaint will be known throughout the world.. . What I relate will travel from sunrise to sunset,. . and the East bear witness to the Western voice.. . I’ll be heard on land, and over the deep waters,. . and my lament will find a mighty voice in the future.. . It won’t be your own age only, that will know it was you,. . you’ll be guilty in the eyes of posterity forever.. . I’m already charging, without raising my horns,. . and I wish I’d no reason to raise them at all.. .

Sound the retreat, Muse,. . while that man’s still able to hide his name.. . Book TIV.X:1-40 Ovid’s Autobiography: Childhood, Boyhood. . Listen Posterity, and find out who this ‘I’ was,. . this playful poet of tender passions you read.. . Sulmo’s my native place, rich in icy streams,. . and ninety miles distant from the City.. . There I was born: if you want to know the date,. . it was when both Consuls died at Mutina.. . If it matters, I was heir to an ancient line,. . not a knight new-made by fortune’s gift.. . I was not the first child: I’d an elder brother,. . who was born twelve months before me.. . The same day of the year saw both our birthdays:. . one day celebrated with both our offering of cakes,. . the first day stained with the blood of combat,. . in armed Minerva’s festival, the Quinquatrus.. . We began our education at a tender age, and, through. . our father’s care, went to men distinguished in the city’s arts.. . My brother tended towards oratory from his early years:. . he was born to the harsh weapons of the noisy forum:. . but even as a boy the heavenly rites delighted me,. . and the Muse was drawing me secretly to her work.. . My father often said: ‘Why follow useless studies?’. . Maeonian Homer himself left no wealth behind.’. . Moved by his words, and leaving Helicon alone,. . I tried to write words that were free of metre.. . But verse came, of itself, in the right measures,. . and whatever I tried to write was poetry.. . Meanwhile, as the silent-footed years slipped by,. . my brother and I assumed the freer adult toga:. . our shoulders carried the broad purple stripe,. . our studies remained what they were before.. . My brother had just doubled his first ten years of life,. . when he died, and I went on, part of myself lost.. . Still, I achieved tender youth’s first honours,. . since at that time I was one of the tresviri.. . The Senate awaited me: I narrowed my purple stripe:. . it would have been an effort too great for my powers.. . I’d neither the strength of body, nor aptitude of mind. . for that vocation, and I shunned ambition’s cares,. . and the Aonian Muses urged me on to seek. . that safe seclusion my tastes always loved.. . Book TIV.X:41-92 Ovid’s Autobiography: Youth and Manhood. . I cherished and cultivated the poets of those times,. . I thought the bards that existed so many gods.. . Often old Macer read to me about those birds of his,. . the snakes that harm you, and the herbs that heal.. .
