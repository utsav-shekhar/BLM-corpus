I'm not gonna blame, put the blame on nobody. All that's gonna get me, is get me nowhere. I'm just gonna look, gonna look in the mirror. And start there. . [Chorus]. I'm gonna be the change. I'm gonna start with my heart. I'm gonna be the light, be that light, my own light. That lights my way through the dark. I'm gonna see that day, change is gonna find me. But it's up to me, up to me, all on me. To make that change inside me. So I'm gonna be the change, change, change. I'm gonna be the change, change, change. I'm gonna be the change, change, change. [Verse 2]. I'm not gonna make, gonna make no excuses. I'm not gonna waste no more time being blind. 'Cause there ain't no world, ain't no world that I'm changing. If I don't change mine. I'm gonna stand a little taller. Hold my head a little higher. Raise my voice a little louder. It's time. . [Chorus]. I'm gonna be the change. I'm gonna start with my heart. I'm gonna be the light, be that light, my own light. That lights my way through the dark. I'm gonna see that day, change is gonna find me. But it's up to me, up to me, all on me. To make that change inside me. I'm gonna be the change (Change, ooh). . [Bridge]. I can feel a fire is starting, nothing's gonna put it out. It's like this moment's waited for me and. And it's mine now. . [Chorus]. I'm gonna be the change. Gonna start with my heart. Gonna be the light, be that light, my own light. That lights my way through the dark. I'm gonna see that day, change is gonna find me. But it's up to me, up to me, all on me. To make that change inside me. I'm gonna be the change, change, change. I'm gonna be the change, change, change. I'm gonna be the change, change, change. Ooh. You might also like[Post-Chorus]. I'm gonna be the change, change, change. I'm gonna be the change, change, change3Embed
