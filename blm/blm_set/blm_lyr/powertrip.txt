. High on a power trip. Knock them off the high horse. ??? got no love for snitches (of course). Now just in the belly for you to wear that uniform. Have you ever heard of overseerers? you ain't nothing more. "damn Nina why you hating? I'm a good cop". You gotta wake up homey, that's a fucked up job. Think about it, who work the laws you're paid to enforce?. Think about it, you're only trained to show no remorse. Get away with murdering the line and making it alright. "told the court i shot on site cos i feared for my life". You're a tool for white supremacy. "no i'm not". Compare how many black and white folks the prison got. Tell my how much money the system makes for every inmate. Paid administrative leave for every life you take. You corruptive mother fuckers think you got us in check. But when the people's had enough, you best protect your neck. [Ruby Ibarra]. Tell me what's power to you. Is it money is it fame, is it influence your name. Over instruments and kicks. Tell me whats power to you. Take a little taste of what you spit. And more power to you if you got it and you never drip. All i see around here is this imbalance of power. Eyeing these mimes and these cowards hiding in ivory towers. ??? so we work by the hour. Another morning that we mourn until our seeds turn to flowers. See the ones that claim power be the ones that lack them. And they criminalise youth and the brown and black men. All these pigs with the sticks never fire from positions. Where we from these pigs on a stick in a fires position. Cowards that power trip ?? out of it, counterfeit, how is it that now that you out of it that they feeling the power. So we working overtime ??? never people power. Displacement overtime just to give in to the power. ??? i'm tired of being powerless and me. ??? no power left in me. I wanna see my sisters grow the power that they seek. I hope to see my daughters fill the power when they speakYou might also likeEmbed
