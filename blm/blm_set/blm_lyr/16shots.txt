Ready for the war we got, our boots strapped. One hundred deep on State Street, where the troops at?. The mayor lying, saying he didn't see the video footage. And everybody want to know where the truth at. On the Southside, where it's no trauma centers but the most trauma. A lot of cannons, but you don't want no drama. I can't imagine if it was my own mama. Got her first-born son stole from her. He never had a chance, and we all know it's cause he Black. Shot 'em sixteen times, how fucked up is that?. Now, the police superintendent wanna double back. Cops speeding up to the block like a running back. Tension is high, man, these niggas is irate. You can see it in they eyes, they wanna violate. Screaming out "Oink oink! Bang-bang! Gang-gang-gang-gang. Murder, murder!" Murder they mind state. I just made me a mil' and still militant. This ain't conscious rap, this shit ignorant, nigga, hair trigger. Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun. When I cock back, police better run. [Chorus: Vic Mensa]. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven, fuck 12. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven, fuck 12. Sixteen shots, and we buckin' back. Sixteen shots. Sixteen shots, and we buckin' back. Sixteen shots. . [Verse 2: Vic Mensa]. They threw a little girl down on the pavement. Pushed her with the bike and said, "Stay out the way, bitch". She was bleedin' on the ground through her braces. This is what happens when niggas don't  stay in their places. The mayor duckin' when he fired the superintendent. But resignation come with bonuses and recognition. So we gon' break in the stores on Magnificent Mile. And if we gotta go, let's go to prison in style. Cops killin' kids and stayin' out of jail. But Bobby Shmurda can't even catch bail. So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now I got everybody yellin' out, "Fuck 12". . [Chorus: Vic Mensa]. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven, fuck 12. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven, fuck 12. Sixteen shots, and we buckin' back. Sixteen shots. Sixteen shots, and we buckin' back. Sixteen shots. You might also like[Refrain: Ali Tamposi]. There's a war on drugs, but the drugs keep winnin'. There's a war on guns, but the guns keep ringin'. . [Verse 3: Vic Mensa]. Me and Lord got a clip with an extendo. And we rollin' with it, hangin' out the window. We on 16th ridin' by the police station. We might make a pork rind out of pig, bro. Somebody tell these mothafuckas keep they hands off me. I ain't a mothafuckin' slave, keep your chains off me. You better hope this 9-millimeter jam on me. Or get blown, I hope you got your body cam turnt on. Fuck a black cop too, that's the same fight. You got a badge, bitch, but you still ain't white. This for Laquan on sight, when you see Van Dyke. Tell him I don't bring a knife to a gunfight. . [Chorus: Vic Mensa]. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven, fuck 12. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

There's a war on drugs, but the drugs keep winnin'. There's a war on guns, but the guns keep ringin'. Singin'. . [Bridge: Ali Tamposi]. Mu-u-u-u-murderer, murderer. Mu-u-u-u-murderer, murderer.

The video shows Laquan walking southbound down the middle of Pulaksi. There are squad cars visible in front of him and also squad cars behind him. The shooter's squad car is visible as it drives past Laquan. Two officers then exit that vehicle with their guns drawn. At that point, Laquan begins to look away from the officers at a southwest angle toward the sidewalk. When Laquan is about 12 to 15 feet away from the officers, the width of an entire lane of the southbound traffic. One officer begins shooting. Laquan immediately spins to the ground, and the video clearly shows that the officer continues to shoot Laquan, multiple times, as he lays in the street. 16 seconds pass from the time Laquan hits the ground, until the last visible puff of smoke rises from his torso area. An officer then approaches Laquan, stands over him and appears to shout something, as he kicks the knife out of his hand27Embed
