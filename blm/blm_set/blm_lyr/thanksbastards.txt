Thank you, Mr. Officer great. For all the things you said to me. For all the good that you have ever done. Without you, what would I be?. You're the gas upon my flames. My love and rage all roll up into one. For every time your gun goes off, a new rebel is born. So when there's 41 bullets. There's 41 thousand thorns in your side. We'll take a ride down to precinct 29. And we'll sing and dance and break the code of silence. [Verse 2]. Thank you, governor, thank you, governor. To the mayor and the commissioner. Your monster is alive now. She's taken to the streets. Crashing through your opera house and tearing out the seats. For all the times you sign your name. Someone out there dies. Found a wallet, not a gun. A mother wipes a tear from her eyes. We despise. Your hollow truths and honest lies. Now you can sing the monster into slumber. . [Chorus]. Thanks, Bastards, you made me what I am. Thanks, bastards, I took the goods and ran. Thanks, Bastards, you made me what I am. Thanks, bastards, I took the goods and ran. I took the goods and ran. I took the goods and ran. I took the goods and ran. . [Verse 3]. Homeland security vs. civil liberty. I'm studying in the shadows of our state. I seen the bones they tried to hide. Cutthroat living's other side. The Flood of US bath water displaced. The funeral march of all the victims of your power war. Rob the right to steal the night and rebels shall be born. For ever more. You're the storm we should play after it pours. And joy is sure to come after your silence. And joy is sure to come after your silence. You might also like[Chorus]. Thanks, Bastards, you made me what I am. Thanks, bastards, I took the goods and ran. Thanks, Bastards, you made me what I am. Thanks, bastards, I took the goods and ran. I took the goods and ran. I took the goods and ran. I took the goods and ran3Embed
