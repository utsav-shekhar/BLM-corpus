. {Epitome of Scratch cuts and scratches “NIGGAS!” and “Are your ready for this?}. . {“What do you mean by that?”}. . [Sister Souljah]. NIGGAAAAAAS keep dying. Mothers keep crying. I ask why, why we don't OPEN our eyes. And NIGGAS keep KILLING, illin’ and thrilling. No time, but niggas STILL chillin'. Niggas still drinking, boozing and stinking. St. Ides BIG banking and niggas not thinking. Nigga still smoking, gagging and chokin. Counting pennies and broke and STILL niggas joking!. “Yo, tell it like it is! Tell it like it is!”. “Aiyyo, FUCK THAT BITCH!! Man, I ain't tryna hear that Souljah shit!”. “Kill that noise, yo! Sit down, boy!”. “Aiyyo, where the fuck that bitch in the city, nigga?! Bitch ain’t doin shit for us!”. “You ain't doing nothing for the community!”. {*both start fighting each other*}. . {“BUNCH OF STINKING NIGGERS!!”}. {“What do you mean by that?”}. . [Sister Souljah]. Niggas still FUCKING, humping and sucking. Family gone broken, father out buggin. Ask a nigga something, he replies nothing!!. Grabs his balls and keeps walking. Niggas grow border, wild with no order. Time grows shorter, father RAPED the daughter. . [Interlude]. (“Daddy, daddy! I-I finished my homework. Can I watch TV?”). (“No you can't watch no TV, c'mon and sit next to. Daddy so you can play that game you played last week”). (“Is that the same game with the thing that squirts?”). (“You got it, don't tell ya mom about Daniel!”). (“Daddy, I don't wanna play that game! That game hurts!). (“Ohh! It's so good.. C'mon, I said let’s play this game”). (“Da-DADDDDDDDY!!!!”).
