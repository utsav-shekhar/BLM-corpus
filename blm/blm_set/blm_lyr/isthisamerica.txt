On a mission to overload like Lake Michigan. When polar caps melt like ice in gin. “Aw, shit, is Zero ‘bout to get hype again?”. Who’s nice like him?  He might blow like rice in wind. You mice of men. Don’t like it then fight me then. Kick this beats’ ass so hard it needs Vicodin. The world will end. My friend, that’s a fact. These lyrics will be the catalyst blue skies black. Nasdaq crash like Cadlac stats on Carfacts. I smash tracks. Like America bombs children in Iraq. Gonna be rhymin’ ‘til my head is inside a black bag. CIA agents trying to find out where my crew at. Snitch? I can’t do that. Wino Willy? Who’s that?. No hablo ingles. Lo siento, officer. I spit like aquifer mockingbirds. Socking jerks. On my word. Gangster nerd. Four Four Lokos before four AM. I swerve. Put my dick in your ear. Fuck what you heard. Work the same rhyme twice that’s a reverb. Reverb the rhymes at late night. That’s the wizork. My soldiers snoop your dogs while I sip sizurp. Won’t beg. Almighty. Give me what I deserve. HA LEH LUH YAH. AMEN RA. Amistad. I’mma nod. Won’t stop. Hip-Hop is God. I rock mics like Elvis. Overdose. Holy Smokes. Sanctified cigarettes. Holy water and minarets. Bounce like Turret’s. Syndrome. Up and Down. Bounce if you’re enslaved to the system. B-Bounce. C’mon!. . I don’t know where the hell I’m at or where the fuck I’m going. But I spit so cold it’s like the roof of my mouth is snowing. So I got my toboggan on. Got the mob rockin’ on. And if they try to stop us best to stock on wood for knockin’ on. I bounce like Muhammad Ali in the ring with a racist. Fuck this small world. I wanna go back to my spaceship. Planet of the Apes’ shit. Crazy. Strike back like the Sith searching Darth Vader’s babies. I’m at Star Wars with the star spangled banner. The fate of working man inside a business man’s planner. Tear down the towers of Babylon with bare hands and hammers. What you got to lose? Afraid to die? Afraid of the slammer?. I’m afraid that one day I’mma have to answer to grandma. I have to justify the reason why black soldiers die. And it’s not enough to vote Obama and sign up for Occupy. If you look closely you’ll see that there’s God in my eyes. I would die to break the system without God on my side. The revolution not televised? They tellin’ lies. Inside FOX news. Hella guys. Black fellas, why?. For Trayvon’s pride. Tired of these fools outside. Wearing hoodies like that’s gonna make cops move aside. Bout to force feed you real hip hop. Open wide. . You might also likeB-Bounce. C’mon!. . Vote for me. I’ll open up more liquor stores. Liquor vending machines. Digging in your backyard for oil energy. I’ll spend your sons on my war and call their poor our enemies. All those niggas fronting like porches. You’re like kin to me. Don’t you dare fall for real nigga mimicry!. These words are a masonic science and only I have the chemistry. Pull all the fucking maps out! I’m about to show you where Kemit be. See the Eye of Horeb corrupted inside the isosceles?. The Statue of Liberty is smirking. Is this bitch mocking me?. We done got the slavemasters’ guns. Who’s stopping me?. It’s like I’m locked inside dreams I never gave a fuck about. And these words are my last ever chance of getting out. Illuminati parole board. Mental prison. And they have their doubts. Because they know when I get the power and respect I’m wildin’ out. There are only two things in physical world. Piranha and Trout. And the spiritual world I see clearly with my Third Eye gouged. I hope when they grow balls and launch the nukes, while I’m on my couch. So I can watch the Earth become one with the clouds. I’m not afraid to die, as long as my grandparents are proud. I’m not afraid to live louder than loud. Drop thousands of pounds. Of lyrical cocaine out of bounds like CIA planes going northbound. But they crashed down in Mexico. And now the common folks can get lit like C4 at Texaco1Embed
