They have sent you a letter to come back home to play. But to your dismay, this isn't your day. For the happy fun time has begun to fade. Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned. We're dismantled, we're mishandled. But we won't be skipped and swayed. Trapped within these walls, you left our souls to drip away. The ink decays, the walls at bay. But the reckoning has come today, you say. Boris has no guts 'cause you replaced it with mechanical strain. We've been tortured but we move forward. This disorder kills your day. [Chorus]. I am alive, immortalized. You're the creator, you traitor. Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs. For now, you must build up our machine. You die tonight, tonight. Build up our machine. You die tonight, tonight. Build up our machine. You die tonight. . [Verse 2]. So you found all the pieces to initiate the pain. Our venom stains, the night remains. But the ending's always just the same, no gain. Nod your head to the beat of death. As you draw your last eternal breath. Sensations of an invasion start to course right through your veins. You say we have no brains, we're just cartoons for your portrayal. To tell some tale about a boat and sail. But sure, this inevitably unveils the fail. Splashes of eternal hate will flood the floor and clean your slate. Now we're the tools and you're the fool. Our nightmare dominates. . [Chorus]. I am alive, immortalized. You're the creator, you traitor. Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs. For now, you must build up our machine. You die tonight. I am alive, immortalized. You're the creator, you traitor. Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs. For now, you must build up our machine. You die tonight, tonight. Build up our machine. You die tonight, tonight. Build up our machine. You die tonight. You might also like[Bridge]. I am aware that your soul is now divine. We care not to toil with unbroken chains. So don't toil with ours like he did to our shining stars. So prepare for adventure. We're a whole new creature from the darkest side. You can't take away the pain we feel. Created as monsters that come to life. (Come back to life). . [Verse 3]. So you've come to the end now. Alive but dead inside. The heart beats loud, you've joined our crowd. We are but punished serpentines. Your life with him was fun. But now the terror's only just begun. Now come with me and you will see. We're a newborn cyanide. . [Chorus]. I am alive, immortalized. You're the creator, you traitor. Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs. For now, you must build up our machine. You die tonight. I am alive, immortalized. You're the creator, you traitor. Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs. For now, you must build up our machine. You die tonight, tonight. Build up our machine. You die tonight, tonight. Build up our machine. You die tonight39Embed
