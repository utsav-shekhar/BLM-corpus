Lookin' at your smile. Starin' in your eyes, I could stay a while. Feeling is a vibe. We pick up like we never even lost time. . [Pre-Chorus: Lonr.]. I could do this for days. I would run a thousand miles for you. I could do this many ways. But I'ma fall fast and dive with you. Wanna chase that, goin' crazy. I'm like, "Oh my," but I'm laid back. Gotta save that, time to face facts. If you love me, girl, just say that. [Chorus: Lonr.]. I don't wanna leave your mind to wander. I'll surround you, make you feel sure. Got desire to make this right. 'Cause every single night, I wanna feel your soul (Oh). I wanna grow old with you, make the most with you, that's the goal. I wanna grow old with you, make the most with you (Yeah). . [Verse 2: H.E.R.]. I'll give you some time. Whatever you want, you just say the word. We can do the time. Lock away the key, that's what you prefer. . [Pre-Chorus: H.E.R. & Lonr.]. I could do this for days. I would run a thousand miles for you. I could do this many ways. I'ma fall fast and die with you. Wanna chase that (Chase that), goin' crazy (Goin' crazy). I'm like "Oh my," (Oh my), but I'm laid back. Gotta save that, time to face facts. If you love me, girl, just say that. . [Chorus: Lonr. & H.E.R.]. I don't wanna leave your mind to wander. I'll surround you, make you feel sure. Got desire to make this right. 'Cause every single night, I wanna feel your soul (Soul). I wanna grow old with you, make the most with you, that's the goal. I wanna grow old with you, make the most with you. You might also like[Bridge: Lonr. & H.E.R.]. If we met in another life (Met in another life). If we met on a different street (Oh). Would you still be walkin' this direction?. Would we still be walkin' at the same speed?. Would we still put up a fight?. Would you still make time for me?. I hope so (I hope so). I hope so, oh, oh, oh, oh. . [Chorus: Lonr. & H.E.R.]. I don't wanna leave your mind to wander. I'll surround you, make you feel sure. Got desire to make this right. 'Cause every single night, I wanna feel your soul. I wanna grow old with you, make the most with you, that's the goal. I wanna grow old with you, make the most with you. . [Outro: H.E.R.]. Oh-oh. Wanna feel your soul. That's the goal2Embed
