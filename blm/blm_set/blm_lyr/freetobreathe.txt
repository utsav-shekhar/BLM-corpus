So why should I believe that everything will be alright?. That everything will be alright. If only we were free to breathe. And why should I believe that everything will be alright?. That everything will be alright. Imagine how good we could be. . [Verse 1]. We like to drink with our feet on the fire. We like to argue the meaning of life. Like brothers, we know how to fight. It's on our shoulders to set the world right. What's the difference if we disagree?. Is heaven above? Is hell underneath?. Doesn't change the news on the streets. Doesn't bring us closer to peace. [Chorus]. So why should I believe that everything will be alright?. That everything will be alright. If only we were free to breathe. So why should I believe that everything will be alright?. That everything will be alright. Imagine how good we could be. . [Refrain]. Woah, woah, woah. Woah, woah, woah. Woah, woah, woah. Woah. . [Outro]. What kind of father leaves his kids in the rain?. What kind of god would not explain?. If this life is all that we get. We better hope something good comes next. World is changing. Can you feel the tension?. If you're not angry, you must not be listening. World is changing. Can you feel the tension?. If you're not angry, you must not be listeningYou might also likeEmbed
