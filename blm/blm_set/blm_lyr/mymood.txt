He tried to run up got kicked like its tekken. . Dont try to move daily through raging of streets. If you try to play hero your soul will release. . Your opinions invalid through trial and error. You run up too fast might be causing some terror. . You ready for war? then get up for a dragon. I’m built up with anger might summon the kraken. Cause people dont like me i’m built like a wacko. Lock eyes for a bit then puff up like an afro. . Dead silent cause i can get hot like tabasco. Can't last lil boy got chewed up like tobacco. . And if you want smoke then i’ll turn to an arsonist. Look like a child with thoughts of a narcissist. Room never lit up cause no one is dark as this. Nobody looks at me normal i’m far from this. . Hit em with archery arrows like kyudo. Im not really with the you, no. Who knows?. Maybe i’ll start to like people if they wanna ever stop killin my mood. Oh so never. . 9 tails on the dial pull up w a kyuubi. I do not use guns but my boys bring a movie. Robotic w music i feel like i’m groovy. I feel like a pirate coin stretching like luffy. . I been boiled up i stay feelin like geysers. Walk in with a brick and a stick and a visor. It went from a spider bite now its a viper. Ill calm brodie down if he start to get hyper. You might also likeYou tryna to hurt me? i dont have emotion. You’re making it worse by the cause of commotion. Can't think with you clowns causes i move move w the ocean. You wack if on ig w guns that you toting. (Joven)Embed
