Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash. Just who do you think I am?. You raise my taxes, freeze my wages. And send my son to Vietnam. You give me second-class houses. And second-class schools. Do you think that all colored folks. Are just second-class fools?. . [Chorus]. Mr. Backlash. I'm gon' leave you with the backlash blues. [Verse 2]. When I try to find a job. To earn a little cash. All you got to offer. Is your mean, old, white backlash. But the world is big. Big and bright and round. And it's full of folks like me. Who are black, yellow, beige, and brown. . [Chorus]. Mr. Backlash. I'm gon' leave you with the backlash blues. . [Instrumental Break]. . [Outro]. Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash. Just what do you think I got to lose?. I'm gon' leave you with the backlash blues. You're the one who'll have the blues, not me. Just wait and seeYou might also like2Embed
