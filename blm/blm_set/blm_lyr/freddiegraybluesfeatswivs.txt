I’m talking what happened to you. You were just 25. When they ended your life. When “to serve & protect”. Meant break your leg, snap your neck. Meant to kill you, to sever your spine. No matter what, there’s no good reason why. . When I’m talking these killer cop blues. I’m kinda talking my family to you. See, my dad was a cop. And his dad was a cop. And my uncles were cops. And my cousins were cops. I’m partly here because of cops. And I love all those cops. And I know not every cop. Is a racist, murdering cop. But this is bigger than the people I love. The system’s broken. Not breaking. It’s done. I’m talking white privilege blues. I’m talking confession to you. I don’t know what it’s like. To be afraid all my life. Looking over my shoulder. Behind each officer, a coroner. Entrenched inequality. No access, no empathy. Crushed in stacked decks. Institutions & death. This is not my reality. I’m afforded the luxury. Of shaking my head. I shut the screen, go to bed. I can turn off what you never can. And watch it happen again and again (and again and again and again and again, and again). . I’m talking Freddie Gray blues.
