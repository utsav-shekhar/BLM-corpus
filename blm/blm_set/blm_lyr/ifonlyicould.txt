Joining our hands, united we're stronger. Fighting for peace, caring about our loved ones. Trusting ourselves, sharing our feeling, believe me. . If only I could I'd make this world a better place. If only I could I'd make this world a better place. . Oh believe me, believe. Believe me, believe, if only I could. I think about the implications when alone between the sheets. When all the huggin' and kissin' is tearin' my heart apart. All people standin' hand in hand, celebratin' all different colours. Joining together, sharing their feelings, please believe me. . Oh believe me, believe. Believe me, believe. . If only I could I'd make this world a better place. If only I could I'd make this world a better place. . If only I could. . Mmm believe me, believe me. Believe me, believe. . If only I could I'd make this world a better place. If only I could I'd make this world a better placeYou might also like1Embed
