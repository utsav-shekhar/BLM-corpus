Better than rooted now. Mi seeds we did now. Mi rooted in the melanin. . [Chorus: Ciara]. Young girl stay rooted. I done plant my seeds now I'm rooted. Brown skin poppin', I'm rooted. ATL bred, I'm rooted. Rooted, nappy head rooted. [Verse 1: Ciara]. All my songs come with melanin. Got the heart, got the soul like Harriet. A queen since she born, that was evident. That's evidence, of black excellence. I can tell a good dog when I'm pettin' 'em. Know that if I have his tribe, he protectin' 'em. Mother of a child and God I invest in 'em. Nutritionin', brown milkin' em (Brown milkin' 'em). . [Pre-Chorus: Ciara]. Young Rosa, young Luther keep marchin' (Yeah, yeah). Flood gates comin' open don't stop 'em. I know that life it ain't easy (Oh-oh, oh). Your life it matters, believe me (Oh-oh, oh). Rule out the fakes and the frauds. They hide it behind a facade. . [Chorus: Ciara]. Young girl stay rooted. I done plant my seeds now I'm rooted. Brown skin poppin', I'm rooted. Can't pull the hood out me, I'm rooted. Rooted, nappy head rooted. I done plant my seeds now I'm rooted. Brown skin poppin', I'm rooted. ATL bred, I'm rooted. Rooted, nappy head rooted. You might also like[Verse 2: Ciara]. All my rules stay embedded in. Hard work, let 'em know, ain't no trainin' in. Poppin' off the charts, that's a better win. Then poppin' off in the streets, ain't no checkin' it. I can tell a good dog when I'm pettin' 'em. Know that if I have his tribe, he protectin' 'em. Mother of a child and God I invest in 'em. Nutritionin', brown milkin' em (Brown milkin' 'em). . [Pre-Chorus: Ciara]. Young Rosa, young Luther keep marchin' (Yeah, yeah).
