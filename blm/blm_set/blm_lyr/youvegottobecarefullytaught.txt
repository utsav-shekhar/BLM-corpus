McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest. stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,. comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.. He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an. act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE. GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.

McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the. waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.. Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an. ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a. rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J.

McClane goes there, signs in.. . MCCLANE. Holly McClane?. . The Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console.. . GUARD. Just type it in there.. . McClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen.. He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as. if to say give it a try.. . 13-A    SCREEN - CLOSER                                       13-A. . McClane types, "McClane, Holly".

As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING,. THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he. realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise. ATTACKS us.. . 15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15. . McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually. spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch. from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in. an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even. burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through. the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over. him.. . A WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him.. . MCCLANE. (to himself, shaking. his head). California.... . Finally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their. words but she nods, points off in some generic direction.. . McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses. his bearings.  He sees:. . 15-A    TAKAGI                                                 15-A. . who has an air of authority.

I can recognize someone who just. got off one.. (shaking hands). I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have. ...something to do with this company.. . MCCLANE. So I've heard.. . Takagi smiles, leads the way.  As they approach Holly's office. door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero".. . TAKAGI. Holly went to the Vault room to FAX. some documents...she should be back. any.... . 16      HOLLY'S OFFICE                                         16. . Ellis is behind the desk.  He's SNIFFLING and just as they. come in he SWEEPS the back of the slick desktop with his hand.. . Both McClane and Takagi catch on...but Takagi tries to hide. his awareness.. . ELLIS. Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick. call, and this was the nearest phone.... . TAKAGI. (as Ellis rises). Ellis, this is John McClane.... (with meaning). Holly's policeman?. (to McClane). Ellis is in charge of International. Acquisitions.. . MCCLANE. (shaking hands with Ellis). That explains the recent deal with. Bolivia.. . Ellis REACTS, runs a checking finger under his nose.. . MCCLANE. (sotto). Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.. . TAKAGI. (eager to change the. subject, to McClane). Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake?. Watered down champagne punch?. . MCCLANE. (grinning). I'm fine.. (looking through the. glass). You throw quite a party.  I didn't. know they had Christmas in Japan.. . TAKAGI. Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor. didn't work out, we got you with. tape decks.. . McClane laughs.  He likes this guy.. . ELLIS. Actually, it's kind of a double celebration.        *. We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot. of it was due to Holly.. . The door OPENS.  Holly comes inside.. . HOLLY. All set, Joe.  The contracts went. over the wire, and --. (surprised). John...!. . 16-A    MCCLANE AND HOLLY                                      16-A. . A moment.  Does the sound of the party stop for him?  We know. it.  For her?  It's more cryptic.  We sure hope so.. . HOLLY. (recovering). I was hoping you made that flight.. . JOHN. (quietly). I was hoping you were hoping that.. . She laughs, kisses him on the cheek.  Ellis notes the awkwardness.. . TAKAGI. (to McClane). You wife's made for this business.. She know how to drive a hard bargain.. . MCCLANE. Yeah.  I remember our first date.. . ELLIS. Show him the watch.. . As she hesitates:. . ELLIS. Go on, show him.  What're you,. embarrassed?. (to McClane). A little token of our appreciation. for all her work.. . He takes Holly's wrist, holds it up.  McClane smoothly takes. the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch.. . MCCLANE. Nice, but one of us is three hours. out of sync.  I think it's me.. (to Holly, pointedly). Is there a place I can wash up?. . HOLLY. (happy for the excuse). Sure.  Follow me.. . They go out.  Alone, Takagi's look at Ellis shows his. disapproval of certain snow at Christmas.. . CUT TO:. . 17      EXT. NAKATOMI - NIGHT                                  17. .

He is making a drink from the bar. with the TV on and his rap music blasting from the cassette. player, oblivious to the truck passing behind him.. . 20      INT. PARKING GARAGE - SAME                             20. . The Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the. next level down.

He is clenching and. unclenching his toes.. . MCCLANE. (surprised, actually feeling. tension decline). Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.. . Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie. shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.. . HOLLY. What are you doing?. . MCCLANE. It's a long story.  You know, I. think that Ellis has his eye on you.. . HOLLY. That's okay.... (pause). ... I have an eye on his private. bathroom.. . McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not. to show any).. *. . HOLLY. So, where are you staying?  This                    *. all happened so fast I didn't even. ask you on the phone.. . McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.. . MCCLANE. Well, Cappy Roberts retired out. here a couple years ago.  He said I. could bunk with him.. . HOLLY. Oh...Where does he live?. . MCCLANE. Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.. . HOLLY. Pomona!  You'll be in the car the. whole time...Look, let's make this. easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's. not huge, but the kids would love to. have you at the house.. . McClane fixes her with a look.. . MCCLANE. They would, huh?. . HOLLY. (beat; honest). I would too.. *. They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that. says a lot about how they still feel about each other.. . Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the. door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty. retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly. tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.. . HOLLY. ...I've missed you.                                 *. . MCCLANE. Especially my name.  You must miss. it every time you write a check.  When. did you start calling yourself. 'Ms. Gennero'?. . HOLLY. (caught). This is a Japanese company, you know?. They figure a married woman, she's on. the way out the door.... . MCCLANE. Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember. this one particular married woman,. she went out the door so fast there. was practically a jetwash...I mean,. talk about your wind chill factor.... . HOLLY. Didn't we have this same conversation. in July?  Damn it, John, there was. an opportunity out here -- I had to. take it --. . MCCLANE. No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?. . HOLLY. My job and my title and my salary did. nothing to our marriage except change. your idea of what it should be.. . MCCLANE. Oh, here it comes.  One of those. 'meaningful relationship conversations.'. I never should've let you get those. magazine subscriptions --. . HOLLY. You want to know my idea of a marriage?. It's a partnership where people help. each other over the rough spots --. console each other when there's a. down...and when there's an up, well,. hell, a little Goddamn applause or. an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.. (quietly). I needed that, John.. (pause). I deserved that.. . There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to. say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.

In the distance. he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto. Avenue of the Stars.. . Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the. second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and. turn down separate side streets, heading for home.. . MCCLANE. (realizing). Son of a bitch.... . Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS. OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine. gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he. reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire. floor.  McClane is gone.. . 80      ON MCCLANE                                            80. . under a desk.  He takes in his options.. . 81      HIS P.O.V.                                            81. . The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane. Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series. of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path. if he can make it past Tony.. . 82      TONY                                                  82. . He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.. . TONY. The fire has been called off, my. friend.  No one is coming to help. you.  You might as well come out. and join the others.. (fingers the trigger. of his machine gun). I promise not to hurt you.. . Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then. around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As. the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another. SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near. the cubicles.. . Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past. each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches. the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the. partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.. . 83      TONY'S P.O.V.                                         83. .

He moves to turn it off, not. realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,. steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel. against Tony's temple.. . MCCLANE. Freeze, Police...don't move or name. your beneficiary.. . Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him. calmly.. . TONY. You won't hurt me.. . MCCLANE. Yeah?  Why not?. . TONY. (smug).

REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.. . MCCLANE. Let's go.. . Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the. big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends. his pistol into the hall.. . Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.. . He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that. sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they. slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen. across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash. into:. . 85      STAIRWELL LANDING                                     85. . then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.. For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto. Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly. to the side.. . For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,. methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets. inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very. hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on. it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND. coming from somewhere attracts his attention.. . He rises, moves cautiously to the source.. . 85-A    NEW ANGLE                                             85-A. . It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during. the struggle.

PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the. floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's. boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take. a couple of steps.. . He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking. the boots off.. . MCCLANE. A million terrorists in the world. and I kill the one with feet. smaller than my sister.. . He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then. he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.. He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:. . 86-A    A DESK                                                86-A. . Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper..

The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's. dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with. his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.. . Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the. outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and. pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof. of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the. edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting. the car in motion again.. . 86-C    HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         86-C. . The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center. of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are. barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny. and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.. Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern. camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.. . HANS. I wanted this to be professional,. efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not. a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi. did not see it that way.... (harder). So he won't be joining us for the. rest of his life.. (as that sinks in). We are prepared to go any way you. make us.

The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,. grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes. are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the. dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car. bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the. machine floor.

Just another American who saw too. many movies as a child.  Another. orphan of a bankrupt culture who. thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo.... Marshal Dillion.. . MCCLANE. Actually, I was always partial to. Roy Rogers.  I really dug those. sequined shirts.. . HANS. (harsh). Do you really think you have a chance. against us, Mr. Cowboy?. . A LIGHT blinks on the elevator.. . MCCLANE. (long pause). Yipee-yi-yea...mother-fucker.. .

Powell stands in front of his destroyed cruiser and looks. up at the building.  Behind him technicians, City Power and.

Just listen fast. because this is a party line and. the neighbors are trigger happy.. Now here's the skinny:  There's. thirty or so hostages on the. 30th floor, with probably 2 or 3. guards to cover a group that size.. The leader here is named Hans,. and besides the pea shooter he. ventilated your car with,                            *. they got machine guns and                            *. sidearms up the yin yang.

MCCLANE. (thinking about it). Figuring there's at least one to. cover the lobby, a couple with the. hostages...I'd say they came in. with about a dozen...but they're. down to nine now, including the. skydiver you already met.  These. guys are mostly Europeans, judging. by their clothing labels, and they're. well financed and very slick.. . POWELL. How do you know?. . MCCLANE. I've seen enough phoney ID's in. my time to recognize that the ones. they've got cost a fortune.  Add all. that up and I don't know what the. fuck it means, but these are bad. ass preps and they're here to stay.. . We notice that everything McClane has said about "clothing". and ID's and police jargon, etc., has set off a little buzzer. in Powell's brain.. . POWELL. I hear you.... (on a hunch). Partner.  And LA's finest are on it,. so light 'em if you got 'em.. . MCCLANE. I'm ahead of you...partner.. . POWELL. Uh, what do I call you?. . A moment.  McClane smiles.  What the hell?. . MCCLANE. 'Roy'.. . POWELL. Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If. you think of anything else you think. we need to know, don't be shy, okay?. In the meantime I want you to find. a safe place and hole-up and let. us do our job.  Understand?. . MCCLANE. (to CB). They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.. .

Stocky, his hair a little too perfect, the very fact that. he is the Deputy Chief of Police Operations on a Christmas Eve. gives some evidence to his position in the pecking order.  His. name is DWAYNE T. ROBINSON and he moves brusquely past police. technicians and goes to the forward group of officers.. . ROBINSON. Who's talking to them?. . Powell turns around. . POWELL. I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.. . ROBINSON. Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have. you learned?  What do they want?. . POWELL. The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir.. We haven't heard a peep from them.. .

He appears to be the. man who called in the report...he's. killed one of the terrorists for sure. and claims he capped two others.. . ROBINSON. (exasperated). He claims?  Powell, has it occured. to you he could be one of the. terrorists, pulling your chain?. Or some kind of nut case who --. . POWELL. I don't think so, Sir.  In fact.... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not.
