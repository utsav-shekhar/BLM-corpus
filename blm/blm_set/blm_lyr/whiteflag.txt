Take a hit, shoot me down, shoot me down. I will never hit the ground, hit the ground. Playing dead, I'll never do. Gotta keep an eye on you. Patience is wearing thin, paper-thin. Promises broke again, what a sin. But it only feeds my energy. So don't expect no sympathy. . [Pre-Chorus]. Smoke, fire, it's all goin' up. Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?. Smoke, fire, flares are goin' up, flares are goin' up. [Chorus]. Oh, won't wave my white flag, no. This time I won't let go. I'd rather die. Than give up the fight, give up the fight. Give up the fight, give up the fight. Won't wave my white flag, no. Oh, I won't go down slow. I'd rather die. Than give up the fight, give up the fight. Give up the fight, give up the fight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. . [Verse 2]. Put an X on my chest, on my chest. But I'm still standing cause I won't forget. The hell on earth you put me through. I'll save myself in spite of you. . [Pre-Chorus]. Smoke, fire, it's all goin' up. Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?. Smoke, fire, flares are goin' up, flares are goin' up. . [Chorus]. Oh, won't wave my white flag, no. This time I won't let go. I'd rather die. Than give up the fight, give up the fight. Give up the fight, give up the fight. Won't wave my white flag, no. Oh, I won't go down slow. I'd rather die. Than give up the fight, give up the fight. Give up the fight, give up the fight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You might also like[Bridge].
