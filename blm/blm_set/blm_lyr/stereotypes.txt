Va a predecir el comportamiento de una persona basada en su raza y un nivel social. Estereotipo!. . I mean, mine is clear, mine is very easy. My number one stereotype is just because I’m 6 foot two, 260lbs doesn’t mean you should be afraid of me.  I feel like when I walk into an elevator and there’s like four-five you know different other people in there, they’re, “Hmmm, let me see what this guy’s gonna do and let me like double check.” Maybe they’re not afraid, but they all notice. In a way it’s like you know, where in one sense I wish that it didn’t exist, and I wish that I didn’t sense, you know that they were threatened by my presence without even knowing who I am. Umm, although I wish that It didn’t exist, I’m kinda glad for it because now it gives me like a goal or gives me something to like try to debunk and like the reason I smile on stage is because I know I’ll completely pressure people’s perceptions of not only what a violin can do; or what music can possibly sound like, but also of what a black man is capable of – is capable of – is capable ofYou might also likeEmbed
