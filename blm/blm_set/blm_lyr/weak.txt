"No thank you" is what I should've said. I should be in bed. But temptations of trouble on my tongue. Troubles yet to come. . [Pre-Chorus]. One sip, bad for me. One hit, bad for me. One kiss, bad for me. But I give in so easily. And "no thank you" is how it should've gone. I should stay strong. [Chorus]. But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?. Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that. I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?. Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that. I'm weak. Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya. Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya. But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?. Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that. (Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that). . [Verse 2]. No thank you. They call me after dark, I don't want no part. My habits, they hold me like a grudge. I promise I won't budge. . [Pre-Chorus]. One sip, bad for me. One hit, bad for me. One kiss, bad for me. But I give in so easily. And "no thank you" is how it should've gone. I should stay strong. You might also like[Chorus]. But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?.

[Pre-Chorus]. One sip, bad for me. One hit, bad for me. One kiss, bad for me. But I give in so easily. And no thank you is how it should've gone. I should stay strong. . [Chorus].
