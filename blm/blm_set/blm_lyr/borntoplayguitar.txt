I was born in Louisiana. And at the age of two. My momma told my papa. Our little boy's got the blues. I grew up real fast. And I've traveled very far. One damn thing's for sure. I was born to play the guitar. . [Chorus]. I got a reputation. And everybody knows my name. I was born to play the guitar. People, I got blues running through my veins. [Verse 2]. Women in Chicago. They love me to the bone. But my love for my guitar keep me far away from home. . [Chorus]. I got a reputation. Oh, everybody knows my name, yeah. I was born to play my guitar. I got the blues running through my veins. . [Verse 3]. I got six strings loaded. On my bad machine. Show me the money. And I'll make this damn thing scream. I'm gonna keep on playing. And on my dying day. A polka-dot guitar will be resting on my grave. . [Chorus]. I got this young reputation. And everybody know my name. Buddy Guy, that is. You know I was born to play this [?] guitar. I got the blues running through my veinsYou might also likeEmbed
