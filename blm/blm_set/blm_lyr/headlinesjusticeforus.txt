Our people are dying in the streets. And it seems like no one cares. Will anybody speak up, will anybody take a stand. We’re still fighting to be heard, we’re still fighting for justice. This is our story. . Hands up, don’t shoot. Mr. Officer my age is only 22. I got dreams I wanna see. Goals I wanna reach for both myself and my community. See I work hard each and every day. Trying hard to bring a smile to my mama’s face. I wanna make her proud. But I can’t do it if I’m laying on the ground. I’m not sure if you were aware. But for me this is reality. And I’m living it everyday. No matter what I do, wear, or say. In a world where we all see color. Why can’t we just see each other. Then maybe one day you will see. Then you’ll understand what its like to be me. . We’re sick of reading all these headlines. We’re tired and we’ve had enough. What’s it gonna take to see some change now. All we really want is justice for us. I’m doing this for all my people. We’re angry and we’re so fed up. What’s it gonna take to see some change now. All we really want is justice for us. . Please don’t pull the trigger. Even though, to you, I’m just another nigga. I got people who believe in me, pray for me, people who support my dreams. So don’t put me in a bodybag. I’m not gonna be a hashtag. I just wanna live and spread the light. And have a little peace of mind. You might also like(Repeat Bridge). (Repeat Chorus). . *Spoken*.
