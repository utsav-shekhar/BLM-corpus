Miss mysterious, who are you?. Who's the girl behind those eyes?. Just a stranger in disguise. Miss mysterious, who could you be?. Was the ghost of what we had?. Did you erase it from your past?. So I pointed in every direction, oh, well. Looking for answers I'll never know. . [Chorus]. I said, "Go, run for your life. And tell me I'm right. Or let me know when your heart went numb". I said, "Go, run for your life. And tell me I'm right". The saying goes, "If you love someone, let them go". [Verse 2]. Miss mysterious, may I ask?. Is your sunshine like my rain?. Is your pleasure like my pain?. So delirious, casting your stones. With a blindfold to my face. Hoping that you'll lose your aim. Well, it looked so bright with the lights out, oh, well. I guess our stars forgot how to glow. . [Chorus]. I said, "Go, run for your life. And tell me I'm right. Or let me know when your heart went numb.". I said, "Go, run for your life. And tell me I'm right.". The saying goes, "If you love someone, let them go". . [Verse 3]. Now, baby, you, you broke my heart. Now how do I get closure when you're only ever closed off. Tell me who could take your place. When these memories are telling me. That we were not a waste?. Now don't even try to tell me that I should just relax. And when our train derailed off the tracks. I tried to reach, outstretch my hand but you turned around instead. So many nights living inside just to connect with you. Now I'm trying hard to win this but we've lost all we can lose.

The saying goes, "If you love someone, let them go". . [Outro]. I stole the moon. I drove through that bleak December. Baby, baby, just for you. You were my touch of duality. And I'll haunt your every dream. I won't worry 'bout a thing. Cause if you love someone. Said if you love someone. Now if you love someone, yeah. Let them go. Let them go7Embed
