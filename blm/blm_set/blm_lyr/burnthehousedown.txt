Used to keep it cool. Used to be a fool. All about the bounce in my step. Watch it on the news. Whatcha gonna do?. I could hit refresh and forget. Used to keep it cool. . [Verse 2: Jack]. Should I keep it light?. Stay out of the fight?. No one’s gonna listen to me. If I write a song. Preaching what is wrong. Will they let me sing on TV?. Should I keep it light?. Is that right?. [Chorus]. Way up way up we go. Been up and down that road. Way up way up, oh no. We gon’ burn the whole house down. Watch me stand in the line. You’re only serving lies. You’ve got something to hide. We gon’ burn the whole house down. We gon’ burn the whole house down. . [Verse 3: Jack]. Yeah, used to let it go. Walk into the show. Gawking at the tricks up your sleeve. Too good to be truth-. Full, I’m in a room. Full of entertainers and thieves. Used to let it go. Woah, oh no. (Woah, oh no). . [Chorus]. Way up way up we go. Been up and down that road. Way up way up, oh no. We gon’ burn the whole house down. Watch me stand in the line. You’re only serving lies. You’ve got something to hide. We gon’ burn the whole house down. We gon’ burn the whole house down.

Used to hang my head low. Now I hear it loud. Every stranger from Twitter is gonna burn this down. . [Chorus]. Way up way up we go. Been up and down that road. Way up way up, oh no. We gon’ burn the whole house down. Watch me stand in the line (whoa oh). You’re only serving lies (yeah). You’ve got something to hide. We gon’ burn the whole house down. Woah oh, yeah. We gon’ burn the whole house down. We burn it down, we burn it down. We gon’ burn the whole house down42Embed
