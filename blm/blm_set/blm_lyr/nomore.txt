I'm losing hold. I'm losing hope. You need to know. It's getting old. I'm losing hope. And so, I don't wanna talk no more. [Chorus]. I don't wanna talk no more. I don't wanna talk no more, (no more). I don't wanna talk no more. I don't wanna talk no more. I don't wanna talk no more, (no more). I don't wanna talk no more. . [Verse 2]. I've been sleeping all day. Hiding from this fake craze. Smoke it till it fades away. Don't wanna wake up. Don't waste my time with the fake love. We all stay the way that they made us. Folding all of my cards. This is getting too far. . [Bridge]. What else is there to say?. Maybe that's okay. Maybe that's okay. Maybe that's okay. Maybe that's okay. What else is there to say?. You need to know. It's getting old, (What else is there to say?). I'm losing all hope. I'm losing all hold, (What else is there to say?). You need to know. It's getting old, (What else is there to say?). I'm losing all hope. And so, I don't wanna talk no more.
