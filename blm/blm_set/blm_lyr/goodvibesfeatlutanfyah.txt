We're bringing only good vibes. . [Verse 1]. People walking down, talking down on others. You can't know yourself without knowing about the other. And I know. That ain't the right way to go. . [Verse 2]. I've got a hunch that we don't wanted this. Let's move away from hate and prejudice. The racist man yeah he's full of it. Let's learn about the culture opposite, now. [Pre-Chorus]. Don't judge a book by the cover. People take a look at the world and discover. That beauty is the word that I think of when I see the different colors of skin. And I'll rejoice and sing for them. . [Chorus]. Oh, no, no, no, the hatred keeps building up, yeah. Oh, no, no, no, the tension keeps on building up, yeah. Oh, no, no, no, the hatred keeps building up, yeah. Oh, no, no, no, the racism is killing us. . [Verse 3]. When we come around. Try to keep compassion on the ground. Feel a sense of freedom with crowd. Connecting people with the sound. . [Verse 4]. Well it's a choice to be grateful. People focus on the enemy and that's hateful. The daily news has got a picture of a man, they say I'm supposed to hate. So great, just another stereotype to make. . [Chorus]. Oh, no, no, no, the hatred keeps building up, yeah. Oh, no, no, no, the tension keeps on building up, yeah. Oh, no, no, no, the hatred keeps building up, yeah. Oh, no, no, no, the racism is killing us. You might also like[Verse 5]. Too many times that I've seen the wrong signs. Back up with your hatred in life. 'Cuz we're bringing only good vibes.
