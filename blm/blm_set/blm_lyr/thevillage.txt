They say, "Don't dare, don't you even go there. Cutting off your long hair. You do as you're told". Tell you, "Wake up, go put on your makeup. This is just a phase you're gonna outgrow". [Chorus]. There's something wrong in the village. In the village, oh. They stare in the village. In the village, oh. There's nothing wrong with you. It's true, it's true. There's something wrong with the village. With the village. There's something wrong with the village. . [Verse 2]. Feel the rumors follow you. From Monday all the way to Friday dinner. You got one day of shelter. Then it's Sunday hell to pay, you young lost sinner. Well I've been there, sitting in that same chair. Whispering that same prayer half a million times. It's a lie though, buried in disciples. One page of the Bible isn't worth a life. . [Chorus]. There's something wrong in the village. In the village, oh. They stare in the village. In the village, oh. There's nothing wrong with you. It's true, it's true. There's something wrong with the village. With the village. Something wrong with the village. You might also like[Break]. .

There's something wrong with the village. With the village. Something wrong with the village39Embed
