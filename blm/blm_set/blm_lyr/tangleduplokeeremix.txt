One, two, three, four!. . [Verse 1]. I took the perfect avenue. Down the road to both of you. Did I go Dutch?. This is too much. With all the money in the world, you could never buy this girl. Quite enough, it will be tough. If romancing me with neons is something you should do. Make the letters bright and luminous and blue. [Chorus]. And get me wakin' up, shake it up. Tangled up. You could be quakin' up, make it up. Tangled up. You can't be fakin' it, makin' it from my love. Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up. . [Post-chrous]. (Ya ya). (Ya ya ya ya). Tangled up. (Ya ya). (Ya ya ya ya). (Ya ya). (Ya ya ya ya). Tangled up. (Ya ya). (Ya ya ya ya). . [Verse 2]. I can't separate your sins, to me you're acting like you're twins. This is a mess. Is this a test?. How many guesses do I get til' only one of you is left?. You're quite the same, if love's the game. I want to see emotions colouring the sky. To the point it will make me wanna cry.

Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up. . [Post-chrous]. (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). Tangled up. (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). Tangled up. (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya-). (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). Tangled up. (Ya ya, ooo). (Ya ya ya ya). [Bridge]. Treating girls like a yo-yo. Is a no no of a monumental kind. If playing with your string happens to be your thing. It's easy to say to both "Oh, nevermind.". . [Chorus]. And get me wakin' up, shake it up. Tangled up. You could be quakin' up, make it up. Tangled up. You can't be fakin' it, makin' it from my love. Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up. . [Outro]. Mmm-uuum. Tangled up. Mmm-ooo. Tangled up. Hmm, hm-hmm. Tangled up. Ohhuoo, oh-oh-oh. Tangled up1Embed
