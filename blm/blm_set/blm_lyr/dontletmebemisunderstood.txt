Baby, do you understand me now. If, sometimes, you see that I'm mad?. Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?. When everything goes wrong, you see some bad. . [Chorus]. But, oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh, Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood. . [Verse 2]. You know, sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree. With a joy that's hard to hide. And then, sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry. And then you're bound to see my other side. [Chorus]. But, oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh, Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood. . [Bridge]. If I seem edgy, I want you to know. I never mean to take it out on you. Life has its problems, and I get more than my share. But that's one thing I never mean to do, 'cause I love you. . [Verse 3]. Oh, oh-oh-oh, baby, I'm just human. Don't you know I have faults, like anyone?. Sometimes, I find myself alone, regretting some little foolish thing. Some simple thing that I've done. . [Chorus]. 'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh, Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood. . [Outro]. Don't let me be misunderstood. I try so hard, so please, don't let me be misunderstoodYou might also like5Embed
