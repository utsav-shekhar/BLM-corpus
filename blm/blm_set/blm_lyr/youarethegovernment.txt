And you know I wish that I could got there. It's a road that I have not found. And I wish you the best of luck, dear. Drop a card or letter to my side of town. Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend. But baby I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and. You... painted my entire world. But I... don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled. And I won't forget it. There's a place where everyone can be right. Even though you remain determined to be opposed.

And when the farm is good and bought, you'll be there without a thought. And eternity, my friend, is a long f*cking time. Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend. But baby I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and. You... painted my entire world. But I... don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled. And I won't forget itYou might also likeEmbed
