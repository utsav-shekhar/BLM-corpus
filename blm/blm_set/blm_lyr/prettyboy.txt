Have we got a tough guy here?. Have we got a tough guy from the street?. And he looks just like that dancing wop. In those movies that we've seen. With his cute little chicken shit boots on. And his cute little chicken shit hat. And his cute little chicken shit girlfriend. Ridin' along in back. . [Verse 2]. What's been happening with you boys?. Are you having a nice time on your trip?. All the way from Jersey City. And you look pretty as a picture. Please don't hurt no one tonight. Please don't break no woman's heart. How 'bout it, you little prick?. How 'bout it?. [Verse 3]. Hope we're gonna get the chance. To show you 'round. Hope we're gonna get the chance. To show you 'round. Talk tough to me, pretty boy. Tell us all about the mean streets of home.
