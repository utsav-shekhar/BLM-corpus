What's the deal?. Be for real. What's the deal?. Be for real. What's the deal?. Be for real. What's the deal?. Be for real. . [Bridge]. Say ow. [Verse 1]. Well I'm sweeter than honey. I'm on the money and hotter than hot can be. I'm softer than a pearl on any black girl that's D-E-N-Y-C-E. I may not be known from coast to coast. But I can rock the mic and I can rock the most. I'm not as famous as the rest. But I still hang out with the best. When I close my eyes, I reminisce. About the very day my fame first hit. It was a battle of the DJs from around the world. It was me, Wonder Woman, and Supergirl. I rocked 'em hard, I rocked 'em well. I showed 'em who had the clientele. They couldn't believe how I rapped to the beat. And they ran away just like dogs in heat. Well now do it, I do it. And I do it, do it good. I'm makin' a start on the mic on my way to Hollywood. Make sure the best beat puts you in a trance. Make your feet feel the heat when you do the freak dance. Like a lime to a lemon and a peach to a plum. Like havin' sex without the yum-yum. Like a dollar bill that is not green. Like Kojac without a baldy thing. Like Michael Jackson without a 'fro. Like a G.I. without the Joe. Like Christmas Day without some snow. That's how I am without a stereo. You got the bass in your face. You got the highs in your eyes. And any means you think you got I want to satisfy. I wanna skip, dip and tranquilize. I wanna hip hop and hypnotize. Ya to the beat, the big beat. A rock rock y'all, get on your feet. And snap your fingers to my funky beat. I'm not Frankie Crocker, I'm not Eddie Cheba. But I sho' 'nuff, sho' 'nuff wanna please ya. I'm not Roscoe nor the Sugarhill Gang. It's just little old me but we rock the same. You want fun? You're gonna get some. A rock rock y'all, with Denyce. And shake your body to my groovy beat. I'm five-foot three and a half. But I can double in size for any man. I like 'em tall, but not too slim. I like the boys but I love the men. I like to be seen in high class bars. Pretty furs and fancy cars. Sasson jeans and sparklin' jewels. Sweetness talks but money rules. I got big brown eyes and golden lips. The juicy kind you wanna kiss with. I wanna ooh-ow, ooh-ooh, the ow-ow. I wanna see your body wow. Do the Jerk, when you feel berserk. Do the Freak, when you feel the beat. Do the Stank, when the car won't crank. Do the Patty Duke in your dancin' suit. And the Fred Astaire when you just don't care. Feel the juice, well let the goose loose. 'Cause it's on and on and on-on and on. And on and on and on. And you jerk and you work the beat in your feet. 'Til 8 o'clock in the morn'. Well now do it, I do it. And I'm doin' it to ya good. I'm makin' a stop on the mic on my way to Hollywood. I'm gonna get there any way I can. By a cute shoe or a new Trans-Am. 'Cause I'm a shining star shinin' bright in the great blue sky. And if anyone asks I'm sure to tell that. These are the reasons why. Well I can do a soft shoe, I can sing the blues. And I can act up a storm. I'm so good that when it's cold outside. I can make you think it's warm. I got stars in my eyes I got glitter in my soul. And spotlights in my heart. Well I'm just waiting for my break before my startin' starts. You want the point? Well I'm the joint. No better and no worse. Farrah Fawcett wouldn't have got the job. If they had seen my first. Give me the part, give me a start. 'Cause I'm qualified to steal your heart. You might also like[Hook].

Fly guys, what you got for me?. Five, six, seven, eight. In your bobby socks and your rollerskate. When I was a young girl of nine or ten. Mama took me by the hand. She said "Girl you can be what you wanna be. Just as well as any man". She said "All you gotta do is remember these rules and one day you'll find 'em true". "When the going gets rough and the rough get going, here's what you got to do". "Well you wink one eye, put your hand on your hip and you blow a little kiss". "And to this very day, I can truly say, honey you just can't miss. Well I use it, I don't abuse it, and I can prove it like I should. I'm female to the max and I play the part damn good. No hotels, no motels, no Holiday Inns. I pick the place, the time, the night and only I say when. I wanna skip, dip and tranquilize. I wanna hip hop and hypnotize. Ya to the beat, the big beat. Let me prove you right on out of your seat. I wanna ooh-ow, ooh-ooh, the ow-ow. I wanna see your body out. I was born under the Zodiac sign of the 12th house Pisces. A Pisces in day may be moody but be sure it will be spicy. Feel the juice, let the goose loose. You want fun? You're gonna get some. I'm gonna do it. Gonna do it. I'm gonna do it to ya good. I'm keepin' the pep in my step all the way to Hollywood. Every minute of every hour of every day of the week. The bells are chimin' when my mind is rhymin'. And the rhymes are all unique. They're snappy, they're peppy, they're sassy and they're cool. I'm gonna be the first girl on my block with her own MC school. I'll make ya feel the bass beat, put ya in a trance. Make your feet feel the heat when you do the freak dance. I'm a chocolate swirl, I'm a sweet black girl. Some say I'm heaven-sent. Even though my words say different I'm a picture of innocence. You got the bass in your face. You got the highs in your eyes. And any means you think you got I want to satisfy. Well I went to the disco the other night. To see just what was up. Well we were clapping our hands and stomping our feet. And funkin' up the funk. A guy came over to talk to me with Disco breath so fierce. He looked in my eyes for some kind of sign, but his breath brought only tears. He asked my name and I asked the same, tryin' not to inhale. 'Cause every time he breathed on me. I could smell the air go stale. I wanted to run, I wanted to hide. The very first chance I got. 'Cause there's nothin' worse in the whole wide world. Than disco breath that's hot. He killed my fire, I was cold to the night. But he stuck to me like white on rice. Didn't want be bad, didn't wanna be mean. But he should've got down with some Listerine. I couldn't take no more, I couldn't stand no more. No way, uh uh, no go. I couldn't take standin' there talkin' to him. Without puttin' my hands on my nose. So when I got my chance, I said a few words. I flapped my wings and honey did the bird. To the beat, to the beat. To the beat that makes you wanna freak. All the guys, get the girls. In the baggy pants and the Jheri curls. And you jerk and you work the beat in your feet. 'Til 8 o'clock in the morn'. I said a hip, hop, a hip-hip-a-hop. Don'tcha dare stop that body rock. I said a one, two, a one-two-three. Fly guys, what you got for me?. Five, six, seven, eight. I wanna give you more than you can take. A rock rock y'all, stomp your feet. And shake your body to my funky beat. 'Cause I'm sweeter than honey. I'm on the money and hotter than hot can be. I'm softer than a pearl on any black girl that's D-E-N-Y-C-E. Hear me right, hear me good. 'Cause I'm on my way to Hollywood. That's D-E-N-Y-C-E. D most, D sweet, D best MC best. [Hook]. What's the deal?. Be for real. What's the deal?. Be for real.
