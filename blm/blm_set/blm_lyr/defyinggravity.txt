Taking loved ones every day. Something gotta change we. Could use some love and lord I pray. Far too many victims gone. And they didn't have to bleed. But I know they're with the angels. Defying gravity. Throw away your bombs. All your bullets and grenades. If we learn to fight with love we. Can finally end our war with hate. And they can build up emerald walls. But that won't bring you back to me. 'Cause I know you're with the angels. Defying gravity. I know you're somewhere with the angels. Defying gravityYou might also likeEmbed
