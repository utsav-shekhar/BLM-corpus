Trackateering Music. Man, y'all did it with this one here, y'all. People love to use that quote, "I'm doin' it for the culture". But what culture is that that you're talking about?. The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist. But won't do the research on hip-hop history. Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect. And disregard the founding fathers?. But you know what? Whatever it is, it don't even matter. 'Cause as long as I'm alive. I'ma show and prove where this culture came from. And what it's really all about. I got you, my nigga, yo, ayo. [Verse 1: Sheek Louch]. Count to ten and then come in shootin'. Fuck peace, Silverback the new Huey Newton. I feel it, it's in the air, white cop with a stare. New judge in the chair, this shit hittin' the fan. But me, I'ma be smart and legalize my shit. And I ain't leavin' the house without that in my hand. And it ain't only the cops, it's niggas on your block. That talk like a lil' bitch and act like they your man. . [Verse 2: Styles P]. Somethin' like Kris Parker, my Uzi weigh a ton. Hundred niggas on the track, then you know I'll be the one. To tell niggas to suck cock, run and get a gun. It's old P, new P, prob'ly layin' in the sun. Prob'ly on a P.I., if I call you king. I ain't talkin' 'bout rap, nigga, that status go to B.I. You can fuck around and get burnt like a C.I. More bars than jail, nigga, who tryna get a V.I?. . [Verse 3: Dave East]. You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers. Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower. The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor. How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock). Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all). Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell. And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster. The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over. You might also like[Verse 4: KXNG Crooked]. COB bandana tied to the end of the AR. Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off. This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off. The dark knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off. Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it. With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred. Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern. I used to control more shooters than David Stern. With Lucifer, hater burn. . [Verse 5: Black Thought]. Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform. Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on. Eighty something, I've been a threat for that long. Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on. My job really putting on for the city. You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit. Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili. They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly. . [Verse 6: Conway the Machine]. Look, thirty shots, I'm shootin' to peel his top. When them niggas sending shots, they shootin' to get the spot. That I'm in, nigga (Hahaha). You know what it is when I spin the block (Ah). Uppin' this Draco, the witness is still in shock (Brrr!). Fluffin' a brick of this yayo, I tilt the pot (Whip). Tuckin' this fifth, you play with me, you getting shot (Boom, boom, boom, boom). Yeah, niggas still waiting for me to drop (Uh-huh). I robbed niggas for they base and sold easy rock. [Verse 7: Raekwon]. Fur coats and magnums. Come through the hall with the big blammers. Bentaygas parked, let me handle this. Jewelry that's flashy, jeans is a thousand, we slick nasty. Pull out a hundred in your housing. Yeah, it's raw lingo when the king go. Dutch link, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!). Put your paper up and threaten shit. Or tie something up, send some messages. . [Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]. Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, "Sunny side up". Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up. Paper bag over his head, tell 'em come on, let the cries out. Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the crotch smells. Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh. I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest. Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy. Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for the time he jerked me. . [Verse 9: Inspectah Deck]. The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique. Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit. My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit. Only time you been sick is when the COVID hit. Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes. Code name Coffee Bean how I hit the grind. Precision design, exquisite with the vivid shine. I'm like a European watch on a different time. . [Verse 10: Papoose]. I used to run around with a MAC-10. Back when I was 20 years old, that was back then (30). 30 clip in the 40, move yayo like 50. Man, I hustle like Nip in the Rolling 60s. I was born in the 70's, grew up in the 80's. Got the MAC-90, then I went crazy. Do the mathematics, y'all can't compete (100). All by myself, I'm 100 deep. . [Verse 11: Loaded Lux]. I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar. Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it. Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished. This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred. How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?. They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets. Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there. Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?. . [Verse 12: AZ]. My soul is never for sale. My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells. Wish him well, me and mines on different times. Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes. Read the signs, body language is loud. Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style. Then and now, before that was all that. Fall back, official is what you call that. . [Verse 13: Bun B]. I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon. Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on. From the first bar down to the last syllable. Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable. Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White. Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite. Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in. You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?. . [Verse 14: Fred the Godson]. I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy. Fallopian tube, just cut it baby. Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans. She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look). Some paid 4-5 serious. I come through, 4-5, serious. Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius. Gold frame shades 45, Siri. . [Verse 15: Jim Jones]. I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep. Screamin', "Nine Trey, Su-Woo" with a bunch of Bs. Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets. Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak. Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat. Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet. Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat. When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef. . [Verse 16: Ransom]. I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow. Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped the five-o. And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich. For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'. Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past. Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash. Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast. Metal in mask but still keep an elegant class. . [Verse 17: Rah Digga]. Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?. I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied. I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire. Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad. Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare. Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair. They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there. They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there. They wouldn't dare. . [Verse 18: Billy Danze]. I can't explain what I dealt with. Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit. When I come from under the belt with a metal shit. Forever Brownsville, no, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice). I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed. Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC). Where you get the storm before the calm. OG and we treat it like Vietnam. . [Verse 19: Lil Fame]. My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain. Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (kahm-kahm). It's curfew whenever I come through (kahm-kahm). Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (come on!). I'm really 'bout it in the war. Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (it's M.O.). Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (it's M.O.). You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O. . [Verse 20: Trae the Truth]. Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script. It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip. Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip. On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip. Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip. Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped. Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship. And if it's beef, I cut the trip, I never pull up and dip. It's Precious season, nigga. . [Verse 21: Joell Ortiz]. Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it. Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it. Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah). Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis. Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'. At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine. I'm still forty with the forty close. In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes. . [Verse 22: Lord Tariq]. (Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting. To hear a verse for the economy stimulation. With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization. We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation. Ask doubles next to ride. The show gun with Shogun to testify. To show somethin', we hold somethin' that electrifies. N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it. . [Verse 23: Cory Gunz]. Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot. When I vodka, the glocka Blocka! and blew the dot. You want attention? I'll give you the spot. And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, "Do the drop". I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger. Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava. And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba. Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava. . [Verse 24: Peter Gunz]. Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall. Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off. Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot. Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot. Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot. What's better than more letters and buddha spots?. Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot. Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot. . [Verse 25: Shaquille O'Neal]. Shaq Dies', front if you want. Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts. My estate got a shuttle, you punks. Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months). I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El. Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell. And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell. This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel. . [Verse 26: Roy Jones Jr.]. Jones, and I don't need no introduction. I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion. Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area. Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier. A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth. A motivational speaker when I speak the truth. Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof. I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth. Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own. I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone. If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone. M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne. . [Interlude: DJ Kay Slay & Kool DJ Red Alert]. Aw man! Ayo Kay!. Ayo what up Red Alert?. I don't think they ready for this. Well they better tool up cause I ain't done!. . [Verse 27: Redman]. When you hear the shots. I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting. I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon. Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning. The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!). I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive. Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!). Telling your boss brick city boys is fire. Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire. . [Verse 28: Young Buck]. Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas. Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas. Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas. They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas. All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith. And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release. Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece. I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck. . [Verse 29: MC Serch]. Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck. Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck. On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile. To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot. My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CDs and streams. On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens. Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens. Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes. . [Verse 30: Big Daddy Kane]. This one image is unblemished without one gimmick. Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence. The core writer for those that lost sight. Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous. That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty. But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century. Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it. Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid. . [Verse 31: MC Shan]. Talk shit, but I could back up game. The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same. How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack. Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, "FUCK THAT!". Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with. Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit. I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep. And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep. . [Verse 32: KRS-One]. KRS is big and scary. I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary. Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this. I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this. The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out. But you can hear they already unconscious. I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this. Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid. . [Verse 33: Jon Connor]. Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music. You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'. Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses. Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go). Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better. I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter. Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position. Designed to put these rappers out of commission. All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention. Taking it back to that driving ambition. . [Verse 34: Twista]. Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon. I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering. I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum. Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates. Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with. I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh. Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto. Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar. Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance. . [Verse 35: Drag-On]. Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and. Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion. Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'. On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater. Drama King told me "Drag, go stupid," so Imma go stupid. Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost mini couped it. Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip. Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah. . [Verse 36: Chris Rivers]. It's me again, all I be is win, never if. If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif. I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered. And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers. I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma. And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar. It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall. Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law. And fight for yours. . [Verse 37: Nino Man]. We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity. They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me. Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity. I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities. Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'. Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it. Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast. I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad. . [Verse 38: Locksmith]. You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous. Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus. Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction. I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in. You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet. A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it. Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine. Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with. . [Verse 39: 3D Na'Tee]. I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen. 'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan. I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows. Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it Apollo. But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi. You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy. Out your kufi, yeah you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me. You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch. . [Verse 40: Trick Trick]. I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from. If you don't know it by now then you just dumb. I ain't got no pistols, inf beams, choppers or no Dracos. No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls. I buy shares, land, LLCs and payrolls. Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon. Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso. I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so. . [Verse 41: Tragedy Khadafi]. Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though. Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado. Mean face Murcielago, over god flows. Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah. I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters. Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt. All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch. Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms. . [Verse 42: E-A-Ski]. Yeah I'm underrated and I never sold my soul. And I never switched slang to sound southern when the game changed. Niggas say they real, til you see 'em on the real. Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal. For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed. Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill. Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment. And then you'll have more clarity. . [Verse 43: Cassidy]. If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet. At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one apiece. Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath. This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak. I can stomach beef, I done faced danger. I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat. I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean. They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine. . [Verse 44: Bumpy Knuckles]. Out of sight, out of mind, til I creep up behind. Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind. Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider. But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter. Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter. You a tweeter, who admire flame more than his heater. From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters. Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings. . [Verse 45: Gillie the King]. G-G-Get 'em!. Let me give you facts, before CashApp. I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back. Before Instagram was selling up instant grams. Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man. Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'. 40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum. Huh? You little niggas in the way. This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay. . [Verse 46: Ice-T]. It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga. Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic. Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones. Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes. Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest. (Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed. Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade. Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' saute. . [Verse 47: Treach]. Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal. And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel. Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous. Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist. Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em. Even when the odds ain't even, I get even. With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay. Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay. It's Jers'!. . [Verse 48: Kool G Rap]. Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit. Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with. Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip. Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip. I ran through more fine women than Wilt did. Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips. Made a killing off of dealing that real fix. Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit. . [Verse 49: Lil Cease]. I'm the product of Frank White. Whoever acting tough gets stage frights. Getting clearer visions of grave sights. So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light. Or something in your face and it ain't life. So don't play with me, Hell gates await. When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully. And tell Mitch to pray for me. Slay with the AK nigga, that's my speciality. Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A 'til the death of me. . [Verse 50: RJ Payne]. Look, for my next verse I done left Earth. The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt. Expert, I let the TECs work, your neck chirp. Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work. One of the deepest, see you've been warned. Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form. I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun. The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm. It's Payne. . [Verse 51: JR Writer]. All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits. You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business. But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies. Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie. That's why I trip like, "Who you tryna rap with?". Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?. Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips. Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker. . [Verse 52: Shoota 93]. You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though). Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!). Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento. You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro. Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not). Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint. Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight. One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!). . [Verse 53: Ms. Hustle]. They like damn we ain't heard from you in a minute. Shit get great from my present see bitch I'm gifted. They said it's only right they callin' me cold see I'm the sickest. I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery you hoes is scripted. Don't get it twisted me and you was a difference. I'm a superstar you role playin' bitches is pimpin'. Oh and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions. You bitches ain't soldiers y'all just be wantin' attention. . [Verse 54: Vado]. Hey yo New York, get the money, five boroughs of death. My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!). Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats. First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps. Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!). Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine. Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed. The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet. Vado!. . [Verse 55: Mysonne]. This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size. Any job nigga, I am overqualified. I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find. Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs. A nigga play me, then he out his mind. As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine. If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind. Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line. . [Verse 56: Mistah F.A.B.]. Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter. Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like bar mitzvah. You bar 9 your bars done I'm Barific. My bars gifted real rapper my bars Christmas. Cooked like a bar & grill I spit these bars in your grill. Homer bluehead keep a mag I'm Bart Simpson. My bars mention muscle bars I'm bar benchin'. Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'. . [Verse 57: Saigon]. I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this. And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist. My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe. With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican. A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti. What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies. Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie. But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology. . [Verse 58: Melle Mel]. Stop chasing props niggas, top niggas march. By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas. I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators. You a pair of Uggs, you ugly but you comfortable nigga. I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back. Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga. The god-body, rock a party nigga. That can socially distance your head from your motherfuckin body nigga. . [Verse 59: Grandmaster Caz]. I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas. BX microphonist, also known as. The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama. Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama. I'm the one even your momma fall for. I'm droppin' the bat and take it first nigga ball four. I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces. With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places. . [Verse 60: Havoc]. 100 deep, know how we roll. Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes. Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold. Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said. Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say. Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay. Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King. Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P. . [Verse 61: Tracey Lee]. I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture. Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate. The mind over mine over mind over the pendant. I am signing on the plot I will put 'em in the blender. A dope spitter with a pro black agenda. Supported by the black referendum. And this only a sliver of the splendor. Homie it's the sensei. A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere. . [Verse 62: E.D.I. Mean]. They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols. I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue. I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass. I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass. I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest. Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest. We load the spray, pussy niggas retire. 100 deep, now you can watch us rise up. . [Verse 63: Young Noble]. When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop. Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box. Around the same time when I heard Illmatic. I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah. I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape. We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate. Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle. Still screamin' "Fuck the world, doggystyle". . [Verse 64: McGruff]. No more mumble rap, back to that boom bap. No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at. Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back. Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back. Harlem World's finest, let's be honest. You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage. Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck. I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga. . [Verse 65: Stan Spit]. Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop. Slay hit me up, told me body the block. Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight. They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?. Kay shit, basic when they spit. Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix. Your algorithm rhythm off balance. I'm 'bout to start the "We don't care if you die" challange. . [Verse 66: Sickflo]. Live from the Wire but I reside in the A. You admire the attire, I am sighin' today. No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden. Show you with all the cadence. Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in. And what a great game in heaven, boosted my cranium. Bars became za induced with titanium. Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty. With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium. . [Verse 67: Fredro Starr]. Ayo Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide. The game ain't been the same since DS died. Got five niggas jumping out the GS5. Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5. DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at. This that shit to make the heat clap. From my niggas selling cheap packs. Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap. . [Verse 68: Sticky Fingaz]. It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you. Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do. My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at. And my ring finger, never put a ring on that. And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that. I use my index finger to make that thing clap. And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that. So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back. . [Verse 69: Ras Kass]. What you lames claim is relevant ain't. The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes. I shoulda named the metal Baretta the Drake. Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks. Yo take a new era super head in my Wraith. Givin' me fitted call it the 7 and 1-8. Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16. How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?. . [Verse 70: Termanology]. I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to. I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia. And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture. The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona. I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger. Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder. Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over. A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder. . [Verse 71: DJ Doowop]. Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream. Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me. 'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect. Niggas know the outcome. We got mixtapes with features better than your album. Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper. For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas. My mixtape gave your boyfriend power. Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce). . [Verse 72: Junior Reid]. I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets. Killin' all these hip-hop beat. Hey, I just can't be defeat. One blood family, we came here to eat. Murder!. When I roll, you know I roll deep. My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat. Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep. . [Verse 73: Oun P]. If it's beef, then we don't make up after talkin'. It's a high chance you gon' be with makeup in the coffin. I think I bust the rhymes the way that the cops claimin' us. Like "put your hands where I could see before it get dangerous". Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information. State property parties, you wanted invitations?. You don't wanna do that, family. Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie y'all. . [Verse 74: Merkules]. You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire. It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent. I'm closing up both of your eyelids cause no one seeing me rhyming. Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic. These are more than schemes that I'm writing. It's for the fiends and the piper. New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next. Shoutout to street sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up. The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers. . [Verse 75: Wais P]. Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?). 'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on. Put a ho on every corner you post on, poison potion. Give you my life on every track that I spoke on. Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on. Phasers photon, never on stunt, give you the whole drum. Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb. Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun. . [Verse 76: Maino]. I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes. Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies. I was down now I'm up, they surprised by my rise. I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas. Lord please forgive me, I'm a sinner. Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a 80s dope dealer. Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla. The street sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers. . [Verse 77: Uncle Murda]. Always been disrespectful, never been polite. Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though). Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard. Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed. I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth. Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em). And fuck whoever feel disrespected. Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah). . [Verse 78: PT Capone Mobstyle]. The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather. Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar. Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep. Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep. Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep. Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep. Harlem, mob style, we run shit. Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit. . [Verse 79: Tony Starks]. Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers. The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya. Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table. Look like a goddamn avalanche. Construction bags of snow, one scale. One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail. We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail. Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales. . [Verse 80: Mike Cee]. Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic. You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it. That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish. Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it. Nigga Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate. Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization. Realization, realize, real. S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee. . [Verse 81: Royal Flush]. I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me. My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50. I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me. Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks I don't fuck with dizzies. Keep a lot of shooters outside it's gon be hard to clip me. Before I surrender to God and Mississippi. Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties. Falling cost me 260 got another 60 with me. . [Verse 82: Super Lover Cee]. Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative. I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is. Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages. And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages. Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity. For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity. When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity. A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe. . [Verse 83: Page Kennedy]. You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons. But this one emerges. And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin. Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it. Knowing that the Drama King was behind it. I'm Page Kennedy don't let the last man escape. Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk. Get your bifocal lens. You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in. . [Verse 84: Rockness]. I spit stupid, you just stupid. Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it. You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music. We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin. Yo my gun blow drumroll, til it unload. Or til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul. I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit. Get higher it's the highway to heaven, I'll send you a lift. . [Verse 85: Gunplay]. (Gunplay) 762s, nigga never left clues. Crib looking like a motherfuckin evidence room. And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom. And that's only when I'm in a fuckin excellent mood. I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel. Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples. Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat. Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left. . [Verse 86: Sadat X]. The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic. You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up. It's still paid for the bin. And you just gotta find a fucking way in. Now we gonna see who's a boss. And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss. Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck. I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle. . [Verse 87: Grand Puba]. I be the block (Dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets. Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet. I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat. We go back like Fat Jack my nigga Harlem heat. Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas. Put the drip in the game drop jewels and pop bottles. I'm valedictorian ask any historian. I'm back from streets you pullin' up in that Delorean. . [Verse 88: Lord Jamar]. I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers. (Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers. We roll deep when we hold heat. Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus. They manufactured a new crisis. With plans to capture your third iris. I stand with the stature of the bird ibis. I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (facts). . [Verse 89: Sonja Blade]. I'm from where Big and Hov came Pop Smoke cocaine. Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains. Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'. Better than I've ever been America's bidin'. Harris no comparison since. So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence. I got seniority Francis Sorority. Sonja Blade bitch just respect my athority. . [Verse 90: Coke La Rock]. Lets take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah). Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon). First emcee ain't my claim to fame. 'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed. I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go). The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay). Bronx legend, respect the crown. And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down. . [Verse 91: Greg Nice]. I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway. Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day. Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ. Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play. We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay. Smoke your chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the bay. Yo I say butter man and you say Parkay. . [Verse 92: Smooth B]. Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer. You that man in the middle, cockblocker. I been a G, never been a sucker. I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker. Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker. Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this. I ring bells around the world every borough with this. . [Verse 93: Consequence]. Always had the bands like Coi Leray. So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers. Old enough to still date a few cougars. Yet the struggle became a weapon for me. So success became a separate story. But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me. Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory. And I get more love than Diddy's license. We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest. . [Verse 94: Millyz]. Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving. Leave your Mama grieving for the non-believing. On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming. Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing. I quit trapping cause my music is dope. You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat. You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most. They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat. . [Verse 95: OT the Real]. I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize. But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides. Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy. She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's. We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines. Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine. I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9. I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fasion design. . [Verse 96: Ron Artest]. Yo!. You from the hood Uptown Queens New York. Save the milk cereal with the fork. Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way. We on the grind yes I got a lot on my mind. Back in the days I used to wanna punch them in face. I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid. Smoking haze out a trombone Nicholas Cage. Fire tire is burning times is turning. . [Verse 97: Kaflow]. Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep. Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep. I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef. Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak. I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath. A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach. Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet. My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three. . [Verse 98: Tone Trump]. A living legend like Slay on The Box. The big dime baby I'm like Jay to the opps. Purple Coogi Purple Tape I'm like Rae to the opps. When it time it ain't the mink then i'm playin' the fox. I'm sorry king of these Pradas and not Adidas. NDF We the mob and I'm the leader free the opps. Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops. Fuck the judge fuck the feds cause they the opps. . [Verse 99: Hocus 45th]. Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant. Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it. Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships. Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent. Outlaw, live by often, I would die for. I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault. So when they talk, I just pay 'em never mind. Cause when I spot em, I'ma dot em like the letter I. . [Verse 100: Omar Epps]. I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more. Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all. Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song. Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg. Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril. 'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process. I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture. Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us. We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing. Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines. The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot. Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN. P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos. With flowers from the mall with no GMOs or cheat codes. The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego. O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn. . [Verse 101: Bodega Bamz]. Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?. Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here. The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most. The most almost famous, the most favorite. Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?. First class back from Switzerland, no capping. I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?. It's perfect timing. Load up the Uzi, headshot, take the diamond. . [Verse 102: Bynoe]. In the car with 2 blicks them shits got 3 attempts on it. You gon be the first full body. Toe tag zip em up the doc won't stitch em up. Sucka ass niggas been lollipops. Spin the block twice won't leave til a body drop. My influence in the hood is impeccable. Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable. *gunshot sounds*. Hello!. . [Verse 103: PTKNY]. It's P dot T dot K nigga. I'm back looking for drama I'm here to slay niggas. NYC tryna be A niggas. Blatant only way you figured out to get paid nigga. And let them niggas have they own style. And act like you niggas really from home. You know that where they shit was grown. And leave that drill shit alone too. Before the shot gets to drilling you. Nigga!. . [Verse 104: Aobie]. These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes. Even my DMs like a bitch to do a mixtape. I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger. Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future. If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us. Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa. They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific. But those that don't know, nigga it's a difference. . [Verse 105: King Kirk]. It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue. Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you. The broads done rip apart you. Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you. No cinema like our own theatre scarier. Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves. Period, lyricists, storytellin'. Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon. . [Verse 106: Big Dubez]. 4D! I go up top they take enough shots (enough shot). Now I'm home, we see what's up then (home now). Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot. All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin. Trust and believe, sleep on the D's. Get tough then, mics, I crush them. Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'. Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'. End of discussion. . [Verse 107: Tony Moxberg]. I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real). Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh huh). I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat. I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi. Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird. I been seein' six figures for like six years. Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber. Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer. . [Verse 108: Styleon]. A fist up for black people, our lives matter. Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it. Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured. Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters. But this a never ending story, them pages continue. My shade part of that food chain minus the menu. It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through. Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it sacrificial. . [Verse 109: Chuck D]. I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99. '89 before that seventy-five. When I was around and I first rhymed. While many searched hard for punchlines. I had some that you cannot find. Had some that you can't rehearse. All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show. . [Verse 110: Sauce Money]. Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know. What's real, nobody else get to spin it. I know these haters won't condone, everything I own. Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it. Bank on that, nobody son trust. After the clashes and the ashes come dust. You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must. But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust. Real talk, motherfuckers the worst. They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth. Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed. I can't wait to put love in reverse. The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay. He said "'Sau it's for the culture, not today". I said "Cool, and usually you're always right. But just remember culture vultures ain't always white". . [Outro: DJ Kay Slay]. DJ Kay Slay, the drama king. Rolling 110 deep. That's right!. It had to be done!. Everything revolves 360°. What comes around goes around. Bring it back to the talent over popularity. Start talkin' to the people. Instead of about the people. Don't test me. You fuck around next time. I do rolling 200 deep on you motherfuckers!2Embed
