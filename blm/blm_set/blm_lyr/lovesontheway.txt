Is it just me, or has the world gone crazy lately?. What's going on?. Can we not see the way we're evolving, changing?. Something's going wrong. Cause every other day, it's the same old story. Broken record on repeat. Another man dies and a child goes hungry. While my brothers cry for peace. Here's another war song for the poor. Singing, "freedom isn't free". How can my heart not beat for these?. How can my heart not bleed for these?. [Pre-Chorus]. Love called and asked about us. Said she'd wondered where we'd gone. She's been lonely without us. She wants us to come back home. And don't you miss the way it used to be for you and me?. Well, won't you please answer her call with me and say. . [Chorus]. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, we've been gone for way too long. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a change is coming on. And if you're ready, follow me. And we'll be the change we wanna see. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or is it far too late, and are we too far gone?. . [Background newscasters speaking]. "In Africa, medical teams are scrambling --". "...troops pour into the country, walking roads and airports --". "...five hundred pound laser guided bombs --". You might also like[Verse 2]. Maybe I'm numb to the news of violence. I just send another prayer. Maybe we're used to this or clueless. Or is it nobody cares?. Cause every other day, it's another killing. And our children have to pray. We act like if we ignore it, maybe it'll go away. No, I'm not a superhero. I just wanna save the day. I can't pretend everything's okay. Can't pretend everything's okay. . [Pre-Chorus]. Love called and asked about us. Said she'd wondered where we'd gone. She's been lonely without us. She wants us to come back home. And don't you miss the way it used to be for you and me?. Well, won't you please answer her call with me and say. . [Chorus]. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, we've been gone for way too long. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a change is coming on. And if you're ready, follow me. And we'll be the change we wanna see. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or is it far too late, and are we too far gone?. [Bridge]. Oh, so pardon me if I cross the line. But standing around watching's just a waste of time. The world won't change, no, the world won't change. 'Til we try. 'Til we try. . [Chorus]. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, we've been gone for way too long. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I feel a change is coming on. If you're ready, follow me. And we'll be the change we wanna see. Hey, love, we're on the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or is it far too late, and are we too far gone?Embed
