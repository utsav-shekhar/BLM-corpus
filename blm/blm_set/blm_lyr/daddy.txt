Everything turn. Its back on you. A game ever so cruel. I would rather lose. Saying fuck your name. Saying you’re to blame. Saying run away. You wouldn’t make it. They always gave. A safe place to stay. They elevate. So I celebrate. Feeling like. The world’s a-dorable. A breeze of friendly wind blows. It’s a summer cool. In my eyes. Like the rain. Now my life. Is all in red. Go off and die motherfucker. I won’t miss you. Not once in my life. You were someone to cling to. Saying fuck your name. Saying you’re to blame. Saying run away. You wouldn’t make it. They always gave. A safe place to stay. They elevate. So I celebrate. Feeling like. The world’s a-dorable. A breeze of friendly wind blows. It’s a summer cool. In my eyes. Like the rain. Now my life. Is all in red. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. Rise and shine bright out. But I could die right now. Die right now. I want you die right now. I want you die right now. I want you. I want you die right now. I want you die right now. I want you. I want you die right now. I want you die right now.
