Don't move a muscle, stay exactly where you are. They took my friend. They cuffed his wrists. They beat him in their van. He hadn't done a thing. But when they came, of course he ran. And they pursued and they were rude. And he said nothing. He bit his lip. 'Cause if you speak, you'll feel their feet. But if you don't. You'll still get hit. [Refrain]. What's the matter with you. My lovely brown eyed man?. How come I can feel you shaking. When I take you by the hand?. What's the matter with you. My lovely brown eyed man?. How come I can feel you shaking?. . [Verse 2]. They want me bad, now bad I'll be. They keep me poor. They make me sick. They feed me with desires for. Things that I don't need or want. Stick their needles in my arms. Expensive things I can't afford. They show me rooms furnished with gold. And then they close the doors. . [Refrain]. What's the matter with you. My lovely brown eyed man?. How come I can feel you shaking. When I take you by the hand. What's the matter with you. My lovely brown eyed man?. How come I can feel you shaking?. You might also like[Verse 3]. I'm the child of the gimme-more nation. When they want something. They launch an occupation. They plunder and they pillage. They call it liberation. They're bombing and maiming. Stealing and taking. But they lock me up. And they paint me a demon. For trying to do right by my beautiful children. They're killing for money. They're crippling countries. They're just doing it all. Beneath the flag that says. Freedom. Now, what's the matter with you?. You're lying if you think. That my pain isn't your pain. Because when I'm hit, you flinch. . [Refrain]. What's the matter with you. My lovely brown eyed man?. How come I can feel you shaking?1Embed
