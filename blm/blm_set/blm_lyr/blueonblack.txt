Push on a shove, it don't mean much. Joker on jack, match on a fire. Cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch. Whisper on a scream. Doesn't change a thing. Don't bring you back. Blue on black, oh yeah, blue on black. [Verse 2]. Blind, oh, now I see. Truth, lies, and in between. Wrong can't be undone. Oh, slipped from the tip of your tongue. . [Chorus]. Hey, blue on black, tears on a river. Push on a shove, it don't mean much. Joker on jack, match on a fire. Cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch. Whisper on a scream. Doesn't change a thing. Doesn't bring you back, yeah. Blue on black, oh blue on black, oh yeah. . [Guitar Solo]. . [Chorus]. Blue on black, tears on a river. Push on a shove, it don't mean much. Joker on jack, match on a fire. Cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch. Whisper on a scream. Doesn't change a thing. Don't bring you back. Blue on black, oh yeah, blue on black.
