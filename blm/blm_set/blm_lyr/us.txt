When we spent all day doing nothing at all. Left my in phone in the car. You showed me all your favourite songs. We danced all night on the roof of your house. And I miss all of that. But it's okay if you don't. Then I keep it for the both of us. . [Verse 1]. I should be over you by now. But I can't get out of this town. Wish I could see the world. A different view. With tinted eyes that makes it blue. Do you still think of us two?. [Chorus]. When we spent all day doing nothing at all. Left my in phone in the car. You showed me all your favourite songs. We danced all night on the roof of your house. And I miss all of that. But it's okay if you don't. Then I keep it for the both of us. . [Post-Chorus]. Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh. It's okay if you don't. Thеn I keep it for the both of us. Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh. Yeah, it's okay if you don't. Then I keep it for thе both of us. . [Verse 2]. It's not fair that I feel like this. 'Cause you seem so fine without me. But I'm sorry for you. If you can't remember the good. Like the weekend we spent in the woods. Talking 'bout how we got through the shit we been through. You might also like[Chorus]. Yeah, we danced all night on the roof of your house. And I miss all of that. But it's okay if you don't.
