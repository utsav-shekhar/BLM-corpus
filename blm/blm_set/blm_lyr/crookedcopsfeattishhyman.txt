Officer, my hands is up. Please don't shoot, but I might run. Run nigga, run nigga, run nigga. I've been black since '91. Piggy piggy, hold your tongue. Run nigga, run nigga, run nigga. What, you want some open graves?. I'll make you catch this fucking fade. My tendencies be  "fuck the law". But mama said, "just look away". Hands up, keep my weapon on me. Blade be tucked so what's up, homie?. Friday night and cruising slow, they. Pull me over, I record it. Bow my head and kiss this ass. And this bacon did smell off. Black and white, you ignite my rights. These crooked cops they hate by sight. Blackest skin, the blackest name. From Africa my father came. From mother earth he saw the dirt. From broken souls to heal the curse. Public enemy? My felony was being black as fuck. Eenie meenie miney moe and hang him up and take his lunch. Call the homies, call my mama. Take his badge and fuck him up. Then fuck him up and make him cry. And remember where we lived and died. [Pre-Hook]. No, no, no, no, noo. No, no-ooh-aah, no, no. . [Hook: Rejjie Snow]. Crooked cop, crooked cop. Crook-crook-crooked cop. Crooked cop, crooked cop. Crooked, crooked cop. Crooked, crook-crook-crooked cops. Crooked cops, crooked. Crooked cops, crook-crook-crooked cops. . [Bridge: Tish Hyman]. I'm tellin' you now. Police in their feelings, they scared and they killin'. They shootin' us down. My hands up, they shootin', they shootin', they shootin'. They shootin' us down. Why? Please tell me why. Scared of me? Is it my black skin?. Public enemy number 1, I was the black man. They be usin' their badges. As a weapon to [?] shoot at us and back up. Tell me why? I, I think I know why. Why they wanna shoot me down. I think I know 'cause they crooked cops. Crooked cops, crook-crook-crooked cops. You might also like[Pre-Hook]. No, no, no, no, noo.

Officer, my record flawless. Rappin' since like '96. When ODB was runnin' shit. Grammy nominated. Hope there's trophies in my cabinet. Hide your kids and hide your wife. The reaper creepin' through the night. Crawl in, Mr. Officer. My fingerprints gon' testify. Tats up on my neck and face. From GTA to gettin' maced. Fuck is up? I know my rights. The sirens, red and flashing lights. [Outro]. Crooked cops, crooked cops. Crook-crook-crooked cops. I don't wanna hear this shit no more. (I don't wanna hear it no motherfuckin' more. You talkin' about motherfuckin' all lives matter). I don't wanna hear this shit no more. (I don't wanna hear this shit. Nobody is killin' your brothers, your sisters, your father, your mother - nobody is killin' y'all motherfuckers in the street. They killin' us, nigga!). I don't wanna hear this shit no more. (The fuck is wrong with you?). . No, no, no, no, noo. No, no-ooh-aah, no, no4Embed
