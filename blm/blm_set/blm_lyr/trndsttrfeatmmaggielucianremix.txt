Hey, you, can I learn your flavor?. It's brand new, now it's in the papers. All I seem to see must be somethin' underneath. Take two, I'm still tryna figure out what makes you. Hard on the call, I guess it comes from your heart. 'Cause when your head's right, you take your time. It's somethin' about the love of things you like. . [Pre-Chorus]. Fire when the strobe hits you, you. Bet you're lookin' for somethin' new. I feel the heat with you starin' off across the room. I dare you, play your cards, boy. You bet I'm a trendsetter, too. [Chorus]. Fire when the strobe hits you. "Think that's it, Brian?" – "Yes.". Bet you're lookin' for somethin' new. Starin' off across the room (Aight). Bet I'm a trendsetter, too. . [Verse 2]. Bulletproof on another level, I hit up the crew. Select never settles, it only gets better the more you see. Powerful and free, confidence is key. So watch me, figure it out. It's all about what you bring to the crowd. Where your preference is loved, they're callin' me over. Set your fire on me, like what I see you getting closer. . [Pre-Chorus]. Hey trendsetter, see your fire when the strobe hits you. I, I didn't see who you came with. Bet you're lookin' for somethin' new. I feel the heat with you starin' off across the room. I dare you, play your cards, boy. You bet I'm a trendsetter, too. . [Chorus]. I feel the heat – fire when the strobe hits you. Bet you're lookin' for somethin' new. Starin' off across the room. Bet I'm a trendsetter, tooYou might also like31Embed
