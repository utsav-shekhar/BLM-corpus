What the universe needs right now is some mutual understanding. The good and gentle kindnesses in every day actions. In the best of ourselves lies a child full of hope. One who feels every sunset and tree, elephant and crow. This is the root of the dwelling place of every living soul. Connection!. . [Verse 2]. All you white men guarding your gates. Know your privilege it comes. From the luck of the lottery. Some bullshit genetic caste system. You had a mother so why you gonna take her down?. Give us our equality, our choice, our bodies are our own!. Connection!. Connection to our universal empathy!. [Verse 3]. Oceans full of plastic killing those who cannot speak. Such an immoral waste of rainforest biodiversity. The planet needs her oxygen, we people need her trees. This blindness is a murdering of every living being. Connection!. Feeling connection to our universal empathy!. . [Verse 4]. We send our brothers off to jails to a system of deceit. Bail is based on skin color, the darker you are, the longer you’re in. Then working for slave wages for corporate plantations. Profiteering from free labor, they want to build more prisons. Then the children go to foster care and families. Are broken. . [Verse 5]. I want to get militant, I want to divide and scream. But I think on Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream. I know that in every soul regardless of their skin. Or age or sex or identity lies the empathy within. Connection!. Feeling connection to our universal empathy!. . [Verse 6]. Om, om, om, om, om. Relax and breathe and look within to your third eye. Relax and breathe and listen to your heartbeat. Heartbeat. Relax and breathe and look within to your third eye. Relax and breathe and listen to your heartbeat. Heartbeat. Connection!. Feeling connection to our universal empathy!. Connection to ourselves and to the Mother and us all!. Connection to our universal empathy!You might also likeEmbed
