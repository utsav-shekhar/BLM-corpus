Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. . [Verse 1]. I can't keep it together. I usually don't show my emotions. But it ain't getting better. 'Cause you can't be blind with eyes wide open. . [Pre-Chorus]. And I see struggle, I see pain. I see only the mess we made. I see things that I can't change. And it hurts my heart to say. [Chorus]. I cry. For the sons without fathers. And the pain that their mothers. Hold deep inside. And I'll fight. For the future we're making. It can change if we face it. 'Cause these tears won't dry. So I cry. . [Post-Chorus]. Ooh (I cry). Ooh. . [Verse 2]. When I look in the mirror. Do I see someone that cares for others?. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do I love myself more than my sisters (Sisters). And brothers? (Brothers). I don't know, ooh. . [Pre-Chorus]. Now, I've seen struggles, I've seen pain. I've seen beyond the mess we made. I've seen things that I cannot change. And it hurts my heart to say. You might also like[Chorus]. Oh, I cry. For the sons without fathers. And the pain that their mothers. Hold deep inside. So I'll fight. For the future we're making. It'll change if we face it. 'Cause these tears won't dry. So I cry. . [Post-Chorus]. Ooh. I cry. Ooh (Cry). . [Bridge]. For the truth that's unspoken. For the promises broken. I will stand by your side. I'll fight. For the ones who stopped dreaming. And the ones who stopped believing. You're not alone. I feel your pain. [Chorus]. I cry. For the sons without fathers. And the pain that their mothers. Hold deep inside, hey. I'll fight. For the future we're making. Only changes if we face it. It's love over pride. I'll cry. . [Outro]. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll cryEmbed
