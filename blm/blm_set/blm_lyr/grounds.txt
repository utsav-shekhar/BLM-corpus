You will not catch me starin' at the sun. Not suckin’ on a Dum Dum, not turnin' 'round to run. No hallelujahs, and no kingdom comes. So you will not catch me starin’ at the sun. . [Refrain]. Do you hear that thunder?. That's the sound of strength in numbers. . [Verse 2]. Fee-fee-fie-fie-fo-fo-fum. I smell the blood of a million sons. A million daughters from a hundred thousand guns. Not taught by our teachers on our curriculum. [Refrain]. Do you hear that thunder?. That's the sound of strength in numbers. . [Chorus]. I am I. Unify. . [Verse 3]. (Hey). Not a single thing has ever been mended. By you standin' there and saying you're offended. Go ahead, tell them what I've intended. I'll say what I mean, do what I love, and fucking send it. . [Refrain]. Do you hear that thunder?. That's the sound of strength in numbers. . [Verse 4]. There’s nothing brave and nothing useful. You scrawlin’ your aggro shit on the walls of the cubicle. Sayin' my race and class ain’t suitable. So I raise my pink fist and say black is beautiful. . [Refrain]. Do you hear that thunder?. That's the sound of strength in numbers.
