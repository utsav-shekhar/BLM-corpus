For Michael Brown or Freddie Gray?. Peace is more than the absence of war. Absence of war. [Chorus: Prince & Eryn Allen Kane]. Are we gonna see another bloody day?. We're tired of the cryin' and people dyin'. Let's take all the guns away. . [Verse 2: Prince]. Absence of war, you and me. Maybe we can finally say. Enough is enough, it's time for love. It's time to hear. It's time to hear the guitar play, guitar play. Baltimore, ever more. . [Refrain: Prince]. If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace. If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace. If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace. If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace. . [Guitar solo]. .
