'Nazi Punks Fuck Off', overproduced by Martin Hannett, take four. (Two three four!). . [Verse 1]. Punk ain't no religious cult. Punk means thinking for yourself. You ain't hardcore when you spike your hair. When a jock still lives inside your head. . [Chorus]. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Fuck off!. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Fuck off!. [Verse 2]. If you've come to fight, get outta here. You ain't no better than the bouncers. We ain't trying to be police. If you ape the cops it ain't anarchy. . [Chorus]. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Fuck off!. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Fuck off!. . [Verse 3]. Ten guys jump one, what a man. You fight each other, the police state wins. Stab your backs when you trash our halls. Trash a bank if you've got real balls. You still think swastikas look cool. The real Nazis run your schools. They're coaches, businessmen and cops. In a real Fourth Reich you'll be the first to go. You might also like[Chorus]. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Fuck off!. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Nazi punks. Fuck off!. . [Outro]. You'll be the first to go. You'll be the first to go. You'll be the first to go. Unless you think!17Embed
