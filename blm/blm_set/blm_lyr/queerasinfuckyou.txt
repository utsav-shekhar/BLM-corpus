I don't want to be just like you. Nobody bothered to ask me. They said I ought to be just like you. . Well I could get a marriage license for a husband and me. So I could use his health insurance for my HAART. Since I can file taxes with a same-gender spouse. I shouldn't feel so bad getting kicked out of my house. Don't sell me a rainbow. Your market's never done shit for me. Don't want a seat at your table. And fuck an invitation to your party. You want to celebrate a gay man on your cable TV. While trans lesbians of color dig the garbage just to eat. You've paved the road for CEOs to suck on some dick. While all the kids on the street are getting pelted with bricks. . I don't want to be equal. 'Cause I know I'm fuckin' better than you. Your moderation is lethal. Get out of my way, let me do what I need to. . There's no protection that this nation-state can offer to me. Just olive branches to the cis white gay bourgeoisie. So fuck off with your rainbow-striped American flags. The only colors that I need are the pink and the black. . Not gay as in happy. But queer as in fuck you. Not gay as in happy. But queer as in fuck you. . Not gay as in happy but queer as in fuck you. Not gay as in happy but queer as in fuck you. Not gay as in happy but queer as in fuck you. Not gay as in happy but queer as in fuck you. (Fuck you too!)You might also like2Embed
