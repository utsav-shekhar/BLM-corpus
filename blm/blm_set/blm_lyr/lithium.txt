Lithium. Don't wanna lock me up inside. Lithium. Don't wanna forget how it feels without. Lithium. I wanna stay in love with my sorrow, oh. . [Post-Chorus]. But God, I wanna let it go. [Verse 1]. Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone. Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show. Never wanted it to be so cold. Just didn't drink enough to say you love me. . [Pre-Chorus]. I can't hold on to me. Wonder what's wrong with me. . [Chorus]. Lithium. Don't wanna lock me up inside. Lithium. Don't wanna forget how it feels without. Lithium. I wanna stay in love with my sorrow, ah. . [Bridge]. Don't wanna let it lay me down this time. Drown my will to fly. Here in the darkness I know myself. Can't break free until I let it go, let me go. . [Verse 2]. Darling, I forgive you after all. Anything is better than to be alone. And in the end I guess I had to fall. Always find my place among the ashes. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. I can't hold on to me. Wonder what's wrong with me. . [Chorus]. Lithium. Don't wanna lock me up inside. Lithium.
