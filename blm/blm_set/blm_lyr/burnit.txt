For all the homies doing time, look alive. For every day your mama cried, look alive. When the five-0 arrive, look alive. Everybody look alive, look alive. You ain't ready, uh. Yeah. . [Verse 1]. See we always on the run. 'Cause they be chasing us for fun. When the neighborhood in pieces. They say to pray and look to Jesus. Light a candle with the sun. 'Cause we lost another one. Got us pledging our allegiance. To a hand that doesn't feed us, preach. [Pre-Chorus]. I got a mouth like Malcolm. And hands just like Ali. Black Panther, white mother. You better not try me. I got a mind like Martin. Visions of Rodney King. My city's on fire. . [Chorus]. You know sometimes you gotta burn it down to build it up again. Lights go out in the town we're living in. Burn it down when no one's innocent. Burn it down. . [Post-Chorus]. I am a gun on the run. I am a gun on the run. I am a gun on the run. . [Verse 2]. We live behind the lines. That they be keeping us inside. And if red denotes the devil. Then in hell is where we'll settle. If I had to pick a side. It's Inglewood until I die. We the necessary evil. For all these fake angelic people. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. I got a mouth like Malcolm. And hands just like Ali. Black Panther, white mother. You better not try me. I got a mind like Martin. Visions of Rodney King. My city's on fire. . [Chorus]. You know sometimes you gotta burn it down to build it up again. Lights go out in the town we're living in. Burn it down when no one's innocent. Burn it down. . [Post-Chorus]. I am a gun on the run. . [Bridge]. Fight for survival, but we was dead on arrival. So we gon' fight for survival until we. Put me in front of the gun. Fight for survival, but we was dead on arrival. So we gon' fight for survival until we. Put me in front of the gun. Oh, bang, bang. Oh, put me in front of the gun. Yeah, okay, yeah. [Chorus]. You know sometimes you gotta burn it down to build it up again. Lights go out in the town we're living in. Burn it down when no one's innocent. Burn it down. We point our fingers while they point their guns. Bullets, they miss us, we're guys on the run. So burn it down and build it up again. Burn it down. . [Post-Chorus]. I am a gun on the run. We still killers. I am a gun on the run. I am a gun on the run1Embed
