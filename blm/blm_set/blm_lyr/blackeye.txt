[Flipout]  Word, yo, I can feel this fat track comin’ at ya. [Madchild] You know what I’m sayin’?. . [Flipout]. This is how we’re coming right now. Kind of like-a-like-a-like-a mule kick, the mule kick. What? The mule kick. So just kick it like this. . [Verse 1] Madchild. Howdy, here comes the rowdy. Lowdown gringo. Señorita swing when I sting ‘em with my lingo. Bingo was his name-O, McDonald has a daughter. I oughta tell you why I’m called the mass marauder. Slam you like a kilo bacteriën, like a piñata. I’ve got a lot of barnyard beavers. So yippy-yi-yo, I pull a hoe like a farmer. Calm her, I’m a charmer when I’m rollin’ with your mama. In the hay, I stay on the deal for real. ‘Cause rats love to cheese up and pigs love to squeal. Ee-eye-oh, I know you want to know the bear facts. It’s giddy-up or saddle up, I never ride the bare back. The fact I hold the [?] I'm getting in too deep. ‘Cause I’m a honkey, straight goin’ donkey. Tough like Tonka, I buck like a mule. She calls me Bob Vila because of the way I use my tool. It ain’t my fault your moms living like a whore. But thanks to me, your sister ain’t a virgin no more. . . [Hook]. . That’s the mule kick, the mule kick. The mule kick, the mule kick. The mule kick, the mule kick. I said, all you'll receive is a kick in the butt. You might also like. [Verse 2] Flipout. So get along little doggy. ‘Cause here comes Rogie. Madchild the mule going over heels like an old fogey. Roll up the barrel and spark up a stogie. Then after I gave more flavor then a polish pirogi. Get the butter, spread it, [?] and I hope the white bread. Make your choice but don’t dread. Now wake up you sleepyhead. Hey, you don’t remember where you saw me at?. You thought I forgot, your mom an insomniac (woo). ‘Cause if you snooze, you lose. Or there’ll be no catching else neither. My skills are ill, so try to catch the beeper. Put a hoe in Labrador an yeah, I can retriever. ‘Cause I’ll be pulling in more chicks than [?]. ‘Cause I can macaroni without being cheesy. I’m the god of [?] easy portuguesey. I’m comin’ down for a landing like Michael on Bonanza. Ride along a track as I gallop with my stanza. So the lowdown, or the hoedown is on the download. I’ma whip the banjo, so yo, my man Madchild. I know that you can do damage. Get on the mic ‘cause I know you get cabbage. . [Verse 3] Madchild. I’ma get the door ‘cause I heard the bells. Flip, should I let ‘em in? (Oh what the hell). It’s Robbie. My kemosabe waiting in the lobby. He’s got a fat hooker, smoking Buddha is his hobby. The Madchild with fad styles, the little rough wrangler. If a girl tries to play me, I’m going to strangle her. I’m running around in circles like a never-ending corner. I can tell it’s so simple, flirt then lean around the corner. . . [Hook]. .

Haa, yeah. Now bring it back, bring it back. Get a kick in the ass. . . [Verse 4]. A horse is a horse of course like [?]. I’m too sexy and slick like [?]. Instead of trying to find an old pro with filler back gap. I find a young girl and spray my load just like a fat cat. I can make her holler like she’s hot under the collar. Checking shows on the list to make a fist full of dollars. I’m making girls heads bob like a slow blowjob. I rob from the rich and I steal from the poor. . [Verse 5] Flipout. OK, now I’ma cast some black and it’s always on purpose. Giving it all it’s worth even though it seems worthless. I tell my moms I’m working but until she thinks I’m jerking. The situations risen and I’m certain that it’s written. “But mom, but, but.”. “No buts” she says. Get your butt in gear. Or your butts out of here. . . [Hook]. . That’s the mule kick, the mule kick. And its the mule kick, the mule kick. The mule kick, the mule kick. I said, all you'll receive is a kick in the butt. . . [Outro] Flipout. You'll get the mule kick, the mule kick. That's what your getting. It's the mule kick, the mule kick. Never forgetting. . It's the mule kick, the mule kick. And now your sweating. All you'll receive is a kick in the buttEmbed
