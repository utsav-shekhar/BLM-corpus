Magic calm, but the joy you bring. Running it down the line. Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing. Magic gone from a pretty thing. Maybe it might be time. For a better day. For a better day. For a better day. [Verse 2]. Straight, from the path of love. In the road of life. I tumble forward. But going on, I'mma keep it strong. I saw your face. . [Chorus].

Maybe it might be time. For a better day. For a better day. (For a better day). (For a better day). (For a better day). (For a better day). And we sang the song for the little thing. Magic calm, but the joy you bring. Running it down the line. Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing. Magic gone from a pretty thing. Maybe it might be time.
