You'll get through it. . [Chorus: Childish Gambino]. Don't worry 'bout tomorrow. The violence, the violence. The violence, the violence. Don't worry 'bout tomorrow. The violence, the violence. The violence, the violence. You might also like[Non-Lyrical Vocal Bridge: Childish Gambino]. . [Outro: Childish Gambino & Legend Glover]. What do you love?. I love... who do I love?.
