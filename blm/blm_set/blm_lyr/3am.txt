Darling, I've just left the bar. And I've misplaced all my credit cards. My self-preservation and all of my reservations. Are sittin' and contemplating what to do with me, do with me. Think I took it way too far. And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car. My insecurities are hurtin' me. Someone please come and flirt with me. I really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine. I do it every time. [Pre-Chorus]. I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign. Come on and make me feel alright again. . [Chorus]. 'Cause it's 3 AM. And I'm callin' everybody that I know. And here we go again. While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone. And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones. Let 'em spill right down the microphone. I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical. I end up alone, end up alone. . [Post-Chorus]. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical. I end up alone, end up alone. . [Verse 2]. And every night, I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen. I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans. I know it's complicated. 'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it. 'Cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me. Know that my identity's always getting the best of me. I'm the worst of my enemies. And I don't really know what to do with me. Yeah, I don't really know what to do with me. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign. Come on and make me feel alright again. . [Chorus]. 'Cause it's 3 AM. And I'm callin' everybody that I know. And here we go again. While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone. And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones. Let 'em spill right down the microphone. I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical. I end up alone, end up alone. . [Post-Chorus]. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical. I end up alone, end up alone. . [Bridge]. I'm reckless, treat it like a necklace. Take a different version and I try it on for size with everybody that I know. And will you please pick up the fucking phone?. [Chorus]. 'Cause it's 3 AM. And I'm callin' everybody that I know. And here we go again. While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone. And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones. Let 'em spill right down the microphone. I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical. I end up alone, end up alone. . [Post-Chorus]. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical. I end up alone. . [Outro: John Mayer]. Your, your best song is a song that's currently on the radio. How many people can say that?. That their best song is the one that's currently about to be a massive hit?. It's already a hit, it's just gonna get more massive. How many people can say it? Not very many. Congratulations!45Embed
