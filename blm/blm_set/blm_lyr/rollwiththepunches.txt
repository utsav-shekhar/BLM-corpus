No food in their belly, no shoes on their feet. Six black children livin' in a burned-up room. One bare light bulb swinging. Little black kid come home from school. Put his key in the door. Mr. Rat's on the stairway, Mr. Junkie's lyin' in his. Own vomit on the floor. You gotta roll with the punches, little black boy. That's what you got to do. You got to roll with the punches. Tap it baby. There's all these boring people, you see 'em on the TV. And they're making up all these boring stories. About how bad things have come to be. They say "You got to, got to, got to feed the hungry". "You got to, got to, got to heal the sick". I say we ain't gotta do nothin' for nobody. 'Cause they won't work a lick, you know. They just gonna have to roll with the punches, yes they will. Gonna have to roll with them. They gonna have to roll with the punches, yes they will. It don't matter whether you're white, black or brown. You won't get nowhere putting down. The old Red, White and Blue. Tap it baby. Alright. Look at those little shorts he's got on, ladies and. Gentlemen. You can see all the way to Argentina. Get it. So pretty. . Let 'em go to Belgium, let 'em go to France. Let 'em go to Russia. Well at least they ought to have the chance to go there. We have talked about the red, we have talked about the blue. Now we gonna talk about the white. That's what we're gonna have to do. Now we had to roll with the punches, yes we did. We had to roll with 'em. We had to roll with the punches. Yes we did. We had to roll with 'em. I don't care what you say. You're livin' in the greatest country in the world. When you're livin' in the USA. Tap it out baby, all rightYou might also likeEmbed
