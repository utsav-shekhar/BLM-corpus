. `You tryin' to break my record, son?' the Flatline asked.  `You were braindead again, five seconds.'. `Sit tight,' Case said, and hit the simstim switch.. She crouched in darkness, her palms against rough concrete.. CASE CASE CASE CASE.  The digital display pulsed his name in alphanumerics, Wintermute informing her of the link.. `Cute,' she said.  She rocked back on her heels and rubbed her palms together, cracked her knuckles.  `What kept you?'. TIME MOLLY TIME NOW.. She pressed her tongue hard against her lower front teeth.  One moved slightly, activating her microchannel amps; the random bounce of photons through the darkness was converted to a pulse of electrons, the concrete around her coming up ghost-pale and grainy.  `Okay, honey.  Now we go out to play.'. Her hiding place proved to be a service tunnel of some kind.  She crawled out through a hinged, ornate grill of tarnished brass.  He saw enough of her arms and hands to know that she wore the polycarbon suit again.  Under the plastic, he felt the familiar tension of thin tight leather.  There was something slung under her arm in a harness or holster.  She stood up, unzipped the suit and touched the checkered plastic of a pistolgrip.. `Hey, Case,' she said, barely voicing the words, `you lis tening?  Tell you a story...  Had me this boy once.  You kinda remind me...'  She turned and surveyed the corridor.  `Johnny, his name was.'. The low, vaulted hallway was lined with dozens of museum cases, archaic-looking glass-fronted boxes made of brown wood.  They looked awkward there, against the organic curves of the hallway's walls, as though they'd been brought in and set up in a line for some forgotten purpose.  Dull brass fixtures held globes of white light at ten-meter intervals.  The floor was uneven, and as she set off along the corridor, Case realized that hundreds of small rugs and carpets had been put down at random.  In some places, they were six deep, the floor a soft patchwork of handwoven wool.. Molly paid little attention to the cabinets and their contents, which irritated him.  He had to satisfy himself with her disin terested glances, which gave him fragments of pottery antique weapons, a thing so densely studded with rusted nails that it was unrecognizable, frayed sections of tapestry.. `My Johnny, see, he was smart, real flash boy.  Started out as a stash on Memory Lane, chips in his head and people paid to hide data there.  Had the Yak after him, night I met him, and I did for their assassin.  More luck than anything else but I did for him.  And after that, it was tight and sweet, Case.'  Her lips barely moved.  He felt her form the words, he didn't need to hear them spoken aloud.  `We had a set-up with a squid, so we could read the traces of everything he'd ever stored.  Ran it all out on tape and started twisting selected clients, ex-clients.  I was bagman, muscle, watchdog.  I was real happy.  You ever been happy, Case?  He was my boy.  We worked together.  Partners.  I was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house when I met him...'  She paused, edged around a sharp turn, and continued.  More of the glossy wooden cases, their sides a color that reminded him of cockroach wings.. `Tight, sweet, just ticking along, we were.  Like nobody could ever touch us.  I wasn't going to let them.  Yakuza.  I guess, they still wanted Johnny's ass.  'Cause I'd killed their man.  'Cause Johnny'd burned them.  And the Yak, they can afford to move so fucking slow, man, they'll wait years and years.  Give you a whole life, just so you'll have more to lose when they come and take it away.  Patient like a spider.  Zen spiders.. `I didn't know that, then.  Or if I did.  I figured it didn't apply to us.  Like when you're young, you figure you're unique.  I was young.  Then they came, when we were thinking we maybe had enough to be able to quit, pack it in, go to Europe maybe.  Not that either of us knew what we'd do there, with nothing to do.  But we were living fat.  Swiss orbital ac counts and a crib full of toys and furniture.  Takes the edge off your game.. `So that first one they'd sent, he'd been hot.  Reflexes like you never saw, implants, enough style for ten ordinary hoods.  But the second one, he was.  I dunno, like a _monk._  Cloned.  Stone killer from the cells on up.  Had it in him, death, this silence, he gave it off in a cloud...'  Her voice trailed off as the corridor split, identical stairwells descending.  She took the left.. `One time, I was a little kid, we were squatting.  It was down by the Hudson, and those rats, man, they were big.  It's the chemicals get into them.  Big as I was, and all night one had been scrabbling under the floor of the squat.  Round dawn somebody brought this old man in, seams down his cheeks and his eyes all red.  Had a roll of greasy leather like you'd keep steel tools in, to keep the rust off.  Spread it out, had this old revolver and three shells.  Old man, he puts one bullet in there, then he starts walking up and down the squat, we're hanging back by the walls.. `Back and forth.  Got his arms crossed, head down, like he's forgotten the gun.  Listening for the rat.  We got real quiet.  Old man takes a step.  Rat moves.  Rat moves, he takes another step.  An hour of that, then he seems to remember his gun.  Points it at the floor, grins, and pulls the trigger.  Rolled it back up and left.. `I crawled under there later.  Rat had a hole between its eyes.'  She was watching the sealed doorways that opened at intervals along the corridor.  `The second one, the one who came for Johnny, he was like that old man.  Not old, but he was like that.  He killed that way.'  The corridor widened.  The sea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous can delabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the floor.  Crystal tinkled as Molly entered the hall.  THIRD DOOR LEFT, blinked the readout.. She turned left, avoiding the inverted tree of crystal.  `I just saw him once.  On my way into our place.  He was coming out.  We lived in a converted factory space, lots of young comers from Sense/Net, like that.  Pretty good security to start with, and I'd put in some really heavy stuff to make it really tight.  I knew Johnny was up there.  But this little guy, he caught my eye, as he was coming out.  Didn't say a word.  We just looked at each other and I knew.  Plain little guy, plain clothes, no pride in him, humble.  He looked at me and got into a pedicab.  I knew.  Went upstairs and Johnny was sitting in a chair by the window, with his mouth a little open, like he'd just thought of something to say.'. The door in front of her was old, a carved slab of Thai teak that seemed to have been sawn in half to fit the low doorway.  A primitive mechanical lock with a stainless face had been inset beneath a swirling dragon.  She knelt, drew a tight little roll of black chamois from an inside pocket, and selected a needle-thin pick.  `Never much found anybody I gave a damn about, after that.'. She inserted the pick and worked in silence, nibbling at her lower lip.  She seemed to rely on touch alone, her eyes unfo cused and the door was a blur of blond wood.  Case listened to the silence of the hall, punctuated by the soft clink of the candelabrum.  Candles?  Straylight was all wrong.  He remem bered Cath's story of a castle with pools and lilies, and 3Jane's mannered words recited musically by the head.  A place grown in upon itself.  Straylight smelled faintly musty, faintly per fumed, like a church.  Where were the Tessier-Ashpools?  He'd expected some clean hive of disciplined activity, but Molly had seen no one.  Her monologue made him uneasy; she'd never told him that much about herself before.  Aside from her story in the cubicle, she'd seldom said anything that had even in dicated that she had a past.. She closed her eyes and there was a click that Case felt rather than heard.  It made him remember the magnetic locks on the door of her cubicle in the puppet place.  The door had opened for him, even though he'd had the wrong chip.  That was Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manip ulated the drone micro and the robot gardener.  The lock system in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside's security system.  The simple mechanical lock here would pose a real problem for the AI, requiring either a drone of some kind or a human agent.. She opened her eyes, put the pick back into the chamois, carefully rerolled it, and tucked it back into its pocket.  `Guess you're kinda like he was,' she said.  `Think you're born to run.  Figure what you were into back in Chiba, that was a stripped down version of what you'd be doing anywhere.  Bad luck, it'll do that sometimes, get you down to basics.'  She stood, stretched, shook herself.  `You know, I figure the one Tessier-Ashpool sent after that Jimmy, the boy who stole the head, he must be pretty much the same as the one the Yak sent to kill Johnny.'  She drew the fletcher from its holster and dialed the barrel to full auto.. The ugliness of the door struck Case as she reached for it.  Not the door itself, which was beautiful, or had once been part of some more beautiful whole, but the way it had been sawn down to fit a particular entrance.  Even the shape was wrong, a rectangle amid smooth curves of polished concrete.  They'd imported these things, he thought, and then forced it all to fit.  But none of it fit.  The door was like the awkward cabinets, the huge crystal tree.  Then he remembered 3Jane's essay, and imagined that the fittings had been hauled up the well to flesh out some master plan, a dream long lost in the compulsive effort to fill space, to replicate some family image of self.  He remembered the shattered nest, the eyeless things writhing.... Molly grasped one of the carved dragon's forelegs and the door swung open easily.. The room behind was small, cramped, little more than a closet.  Gray steel tool cabinets were backed against a curving wall.  A light fixture had come on automatically.  She closed the door behind her and went to the ranged lockers.. THIRD LEFT, pulsed the optic chip, Wintermute overriding her time display.  FIVE DOWN.  But she opened the top drawer first.  It was no more than a shallow tray.  Empty.  The second was empty as well.  The third, which was deeper, contained dull beads of solder and a small brown thing that looked like a human fingerbone.  The fourth drawer held a damp-swollen copy of an obsolete technical manual in French and Japanese.  In the fifth, behind the armored gauntlet of a heavy vacuum suit, she found the key.  It was like a dull brass coin with a short hollow tube braised against one edge.  She turned it slowly in her hand and Case saw that the interior of the tube was lined with studs and flanges.  The letters CHUBB were molded across one face of the coin.  The other was blank.. `He told me,' she whispered.  `Wintermute.  How he played a waiting game for years.  Didn't have any real power, then, but he could use the Villa's security and custodial systems to keep track of where everything was, how things moved, where they went.  He saw somebody lose this key twenty years ago, and he managed to get somebody else to leave it here.  Then he killed him, the boy who'd brought it here.  Kid was eight.'  She closed her white fingers over the key.  `So nobody would find it.'  She took a length of black nylon cord from the suit's kangaroo pocket and threaded it through the round hole above CHUBB.  Knotting it, she hung it around her neck.  `They were always fucking him over with how old-fashioned they were, he said, all their nineteenth-century stuff.  He looked just like the Finn, on the screen in that meat puppet hole.  Almost thought he _was_ the Finn, if I wasn't careful.'  Her readout flared the time, alphanumerics superimposed over the gray steel chests.  `He said if they'd turned into what they'd wanted to, he could've gotten out a long time ago.  But they didn't.  Screwed up.  Freaks like 3Jane.  That's what he called her, but he talked like he liked her.'. She turned, opened the door, and stepped out, her hand brushing the checkered grip of the holstered fletcher.. Case flipped.. Kuang Grade Mark Eleven was growing.. `Dixie, you think this thing'll work?'. `Does a bear shit in the woods?'  The Flatline punched them up through shifting rainbow strata.. Something dark was forming at the core of the Chinese program.  The density of information overwhelmed the fabric of the matrix, triggering hypnagogic images.  Faint kaleidoscop ic angles centered in to a silver-black focal point.  Case watched childhood symbols of evil and bad luck tumble out along trans lucent planes: swastikas, skulls and crossbones, dice flashing snake eyes.  If he looked directly at that null point, no outline would form.  It took a dozen quick, peripheral takes before he had it, a shark thing, gleaming like obsidian, the black mirrors of its flanks reflecting faint distant lights that bore no relation ship to the matrix around it.. `That's the sting,' the construct said.  `When Kuang's good and bellytight with the Tessier-Ashpool core, we're ridin' that through.'. `You were right, Dix.  There's some kind of manual override on the hardwiring that keeps Wintermute under control.  How ever much he _is_ under control,' he added.. `He,' the construct said.  `He.  Watch that.  It.  I keep telling you.'. `It's a code.  A word, he said.  Somebody has to speak it into a fancy terminal in a certain room, while we take care of whatever's waiting for us behind that ice.'. `Well, you got time to kill, kid,' the flatline said.  `Ol' Kuang's slow but steady.'. Case jacked out.. . Into Maelcum's stare.. `You dead awhile there, mon.'. `It happens,' he said.  `I'm getting used to it.'. `You dealin' wi' th' darkness, mon.'. `Only game in town, it looks like.'. `Jah love, Case,' Maelcum said, and turned back to his radio module.  Case stared at the matted dreadlocks, the ropes of muscle around the man's dark arms.. He jacked back in.. And flipped.. . Molly was trotting along a length of corridor that might have been the one she'd traveled before.  The glass-fronted cases were gone now, and Case decided they were moving toward the tip of the spindle; gravity was growing weaker.  Soon she was bounding smoothly over rolling hillocks of carpets.  Faint twinges in her leg.... The corridor narrowed suddenly, curved split.. She turned right and started up a freakishly steep flight of stairs, her leg beginning to ache.  Overhead, strapped and bun dled cables hugged the stairwell's ceiling like colorcoded gan glia.  The walls were splotched with damp.. She arrived at a triangular landing and stood rubbing her leg.  More corridors, narrow, their walls hung with rugs.  They branched away in three directions.. LEFT.. She shrugged.  `Lemme look around, okay?'. LEFT.. `Relax.  There's time.'  She started down the corridor that led off to her right.. STOP.. GO BACK.. DANGER.. She hesitated.  From the half-open oak door at the far end of the passage came a voice, loud and slurred, like the voice of a drunk.  Case thought the language might be French, but it was too indistinct.  Molly took a step, another, her hand sliding into the suit to touch the butt of her fletcher.  When she stepped into the neural disruptor's field, her ears rang, a tiny rising tone that made Case think of the sound of her fletcher.  She pitched forward, her striated muscles slack, and struck the door with her forehead.  She twisted and lay on her back, her eyes unfocused, breath gone.. `What's this,' said the slurred voice, `fancy dress?'  A trem bling hand entered the front of her suit and found the fletcher, tugging it out.  `Come visit, child.  Now.'. She got up slowly, her eyes fixed on the muzzle of a black automatic pistol.  The man's hand was steady enough, now; the gun's barrel seemed to be attached to her throat with a taut, invisible string.. He was old, very tall, and his features reminded Case of the girl he had glimpsed in the Vingtime Sicle.  He wore a heavy robe of maroon silk, quilted around the long cuffs and shawl collar.  One foot was bare, the other in a black velvet slipper with an embroidered gold foxhead over the instep.  He motioned her into the room.  `Slow, darling.'  The room was very large, cluttered with an assortment of things that made no sense to Case.  He saw a gray steel rack of old-fashioned Sony monitors, a wide brass bed heaped with sheepskins, with pil lows that seemed to have been made from the kind of rug used to pave the corridors.  Molly's eyes darted from a huge Tele funken entertainment console to shelves of antique disk re cordings, their crumbling spines cased in clear plastic, to a wide worktable littered with slabs of silicon.  Case registered the cyberspace deck and the trodes, but her glance slid over it without pausing.. `It would be customary,' the old man said, `for me to kill you now.'  Case felt her tense, ready for a move.  `But tonight I indulge myself.  What is your name?'. `Molly.'. `Molly.  Mine is Ashpool.'  He sank back into the creased softness of a huge leather armchair with square chrome legs, but the gun never wavered.  He put her fletcher on a brass table beside the chair, knocking over a plastic vial of red pills.  The table was thick with vials, bottles of liquor, soft plastic en velopes spilling white powders.  Case noticed an old-fashioned glass hypodermic and a plain steel spoon.. `How do you cry, Molly?  I see your eyes are walled away.  I'm curious.'  His eyes were red-rimmed, his forehead gleaming with sweat.  He was very pale.  Sick, Case decided.  Or drugs.. `I don't cry, much.'. `But how would you cry, if someone made you cry?'. `I spit,' she said.  `The ducts are routed back into my mouth.'. `Then you've already learned an important lesson, for one so young.'  He rested the hand with the pistol on his knee and took a bottle from the table beside him, without bothering to choose from the half-dozen different liquors.  He drank.  Brandy.  A trickle of the stuff ran from the corner of his mouth.  `That is the way to handle tears.'  He drank again.  `I'm busy tonight, Molly.  I built all this, and now I'm busy.  Dying.'. `I could go out the way I came,' she said.. He laughed, a harsh high sound.  `You intrude on my suicide and then ask to simply walk out?  Really, you amaze me.  A thief.'. `It's my ass, boss, and it's all I got.  I just wanna get it out of here in one piece.'. `You are a very rude girl.  Suicides here are conducted with a degree of decorum.  That's what I'm doing, you understand.  But perhaps I'll take you with me tonight, down to hell...  It would be very Egyptian of me.'  He drank again.  `Come here then.'  He held out the bottle, his hand shaking.  `Drink.'. She shook her head.. `It isn't poisoned,' he said, but returned the brandy to the table.  `Sit.  Sit on the floor.  We'll talk.'. `What about?'  She sat.  Case felt the blades move, very slightly, beneath her nails.. `Whatever comes to mind.  My mind.  It's my party.  The cores woke me.  Twenty hours ago.  Something was afoot, they said, and I was needed.  Were you the something Molly?  Surely they didn't need me to handle you, no.  Something else... but I'd been dreaming, you see.  For thirty years.  You weren't born, when last I lay me down to sleep.  They told us we wouldn't dream, in that cold.  They told us we'd never feel cold, either.  Madness, Molly.  Lies.  Of course I dreamed.  The cold let the outside in, that was it.  The outside.  All the night I built this to hide us from.  Just a drop, at first, one grain of night seeping in, drawn by the cold...  Others following it, filling my head the way rain fills an empty pool.  Calla lilies.  I remember.  The pools were terracotta, nursemaids all of chrome, how the limbs went winking through the gardens at sunset...  I'm old, Molly.  Over two hundred years, if you count the cold.  The cold.'  The barrel of the pistol snapped up suddenly, quivering.  The ten dons in her thighs were drawn tight as wires now.. `You can get freezerburn,' she said carefully.. `Nothing burns there,' he said impatiently, lowering the gun.  His few movements were increasingly sclerotic.  His head nodded.  It cost him an effort to stop it.  `Nothing burns.  I remember now.  The cores told me our intelligences are mad.  And all the billions we paid, so long ago.  When artificial intelligences were rather a racy concept.  I told the cores I'd deal with it.  Bad timing, really, with 8Jean down in Melbourne and only our sweet 3Jane minding the store.  Or very good timing, perhaps.  Would you know, Molly?'  The gun rose again.  `There are some odd things afoot now, in the Villa Straylight.'. `Boss,' she asked him, `you know Wintermute?'. `A name.  Yes.  To conjure with, perhaps.  A lord of hell, surely.  In my time, dear Molly, I have known many lords.  And not a few ladies.  Why, a queen of Spain, once, in that very bed...  But I wander.'  He coughed wetly, the muzzle of the pistol jerking as he convulsed.  He spat on the carpet near his one bare foot.  `How I do wander.  Through the cold.  But soon no more.  I'd ordered a Jane thawed, when I woke.  Strange, to lie every few decades with what legally amounts to one's own daughter.'  His gaze swept past her, to the rack of blank monitors.  He seemed to shiver.  `Marie-France's eyes ,' he said, faintly, and smiled.  `We cause the brain to become allergic to certain of its own neurotransmitters, resulting in a peculiarly pliable imitation of autism.'  His head swayed sideways, re covered.  `I understand that the effect is now more easily ob tained with an embedded microchip.'. The pistol slid from his fingers, bounced on the carpet.. `The dreams grow like slow ice,' he said.  His face was tinged with blue.  His head sank back into the waiting leather and he began to snore.. Up, she snatched the gun.  She stalked the room, Ashpool's automatic in her hand.. A vast quilt or comforter was heaped beside the bed, in a broad puddle of congealed blood, thick and shiny on the pat terned rugs.  Twitching a corner of the quilt back, she found the body of a girl, white shoulder blades slick with blood.  Her throat had been slit.  The triangular blade of some sort of scraper glinted in the dark pool beside her.  Molly knelt, careful to avoid the blood, and turned the dead girl's face to the light.  The face Case had seen in the restaurant.. There was a click, deep at the very center of things, and the world was frozen.  Molly's simstim broadcast had become a still frame, her fingers on the girl's cheek.  The freeze held for three seconds, and then the dead face was altered, became the face of Linda Lee.. Another click, and the room blurred.  Molly was standing, looking down at a golden laser disk beside a small console on the marble top of a bedside table.  A length of fiberoptic ribbon ran like a leash from the console to a socket at the base of the slender neck.. `I got your number, fucker,' Case said, feeling his own lips moving, somewhere, far away.  He knew that Wintermute had altered the broadcast.  Molly hadn't seen the dead girl's face swirl like smoke, to take on the outline of Linda's deathmask.. Molly turned.  She crossed the room to Ashpool's chair.  The man's breathing was slow and ragged.  She peered at the litter of drugs and alcohol.  She put his pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot, and very carefully put a toxin dart through the center of his closed left eyelid.  He jerked once, breath halting in mid-intake.  His other eye, brown and fathomless, opened slowly.. It was still open when she turned and left the room.Embed
