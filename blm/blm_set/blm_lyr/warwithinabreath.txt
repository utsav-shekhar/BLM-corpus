Every official that comes in, cripples us, leaves us maimed. Silent and tamed. And with our flesh and bones, he builds his homes. Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist. Clenched to smash power so cancerous. A black flag and a red star. A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles. Yes, for Raza livin' in La La. Like Gaza on to the dawn of Intifada. Reach for the lessons the masked pass on. And seize the metropolis, it's you it's built on. [Pre-Chorus]. Everything can change on a new year's day. Everything can change on a new year's day. Everything can change on a new year's day. And everything changed on a new year's day. Come on. . [Chorus]. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land. . [Verse 2]. Their existence is a crime. Their seat, their robe, their tie. Their land deeds, their hired guns. They're the crime. Shots heard underground 'round the rapture. The world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture. The masked screaming land or death. Within a breath, a war from the depth of time. Who shot four puppet governors in a line. Who shook all the world bankers who think they can rhyme. Shot the landlords who knew it was mine. Yes, it's a war from the depth of time. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. Everything can change on a new year's day. Everything can change on a new year's day. Everything can change on a new year's day. Everything can change on a new year's day. Come on. Ugh, hear the masked scream. . [Chorus]. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. . [Post-Chorus]. It's land or death. Yeah, uh. Come on. Come on. Yes, yes. Yes. [Chorus]. It's war within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death. War within a breath. It's land or death1Embed
