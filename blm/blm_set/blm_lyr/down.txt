I'm angry sometimes. My heart's on the line. These problems are mine to hold. I push and you pull. But I'm just too confused. So I'm crawling into a hole. . [Chorus]. Are you gonna hold me down?. I'm high when I come back down. I fall 'til I hit the ground. So tell me now. Are you gonna hold me down?. King with a tainted crown. I fall 'til I hit the ground. So tell me now. Are you gonna hold me down?. [Verse 2]. You're angry sometimes. I'm fueling a fire. To watch it go up in flames. You push and you pull. We're just too confused. Don't tell me that I can change. . [Chorus]. Are you gonna hold me down?. I'm high when I come back down. I fall 'til I hit the ground. So tell me now. Are you gonna hold me down?. King with a tainted crown. I fall 'til I hit the ground. So tell me now. Are you gonna hold me down?. . [Bridge]. I keep on slipping but I know it's not my fault. I just need closure. I know it's on the way, I know it's on the way. But I keep running to my problems. To the same place where I got 'em. I know it's not the way. You might also like[Chorus]. Are you gonna hold me down?. I'm high when I come back down. I fall 'til I hit the ground. So tell me now. Are you gonna hold me down?. King with a tainted crown. I fall 'til I hit the ground. So tell me now. Are you gonna hold me down?Embed
