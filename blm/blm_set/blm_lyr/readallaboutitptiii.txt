You've got the words to change a nation but you're biting your tongue. You've spent a lifetime stuck in silence afraid you'll say something wrong. If no one ever hears it. How we gonna learn your song?. So come on, come on. Come on, come on. . [Verse 2]. You've got a heart as loud as lions, so why let your voice be tamed?. Maybe we're a little different, there's no need to be ashamed. You've got the light to fight the shadows so stop hiding it away. Come on, come on. [Chorus]. I wanna sing, I wanna shout. I wanna scream 'till the words dry out. So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid. They can read all about it, read all about it. Oh, ohhh, oh. Ohhh, ohhh, oh. Ohhh, oh, oh. . [Verse 3]. At night we're waking up the neighbours while we sing away the blues. Making sure that we're remembered, yeah, 'cause we all matter too. If the truth has been forbidden, then we're breaking all the rules. So come on, come on. Come on, come on. . [Verse 4]. Let's get the TV and the radio to play our tune again. It's 'bout time we got some airplay of our version of events. There's no need to be afraid, I will sing with you, my friend. Come on, come on. . [Chorus]. I wanna sing, I wanna shout. I wanna scream till the words dry out. So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid. They can read all about it, read all about it. You might also like[Bridge].

Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people. So when did we all get so fearful?. Now we're finally finding our voices. So take a chance, come help me sing this. . [Chorus]. I wanna sing, I wanna shout. I wanna scream till the words dry out. So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid. They can read all about it, read all about it. Oh, ohhh, oh. Ohhh, ohhh, oh. Ohhh, oh, oh. I wanna sing, I wanna shout. I wanna scream till the words dry out. So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid. They can read all about it, read all about it. Oh, ohhh, oh.
