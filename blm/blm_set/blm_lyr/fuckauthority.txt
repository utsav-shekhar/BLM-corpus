I say fuck authority. Silent majority. Raised by the system. Now it's time to rise against them. We're sick of your treason. Sick of your lies. Fuck no, we won't listen. We're gonna open your eyes. [Chorus]. Frustration, domination. Feel the rage of a new generation. We're living, we're dying. And we're never ever gonna stop, stop trying. Stop trying, stop trying, stop trying. . [Verse 2]. You know the time is right to take control. We got to take offense against the status quo. No way, not gonna stand for it today. Fight for your rights, it's time we had our say. . [Pre-Chorus]. I say fuck authority. Silent majority. Raised by the system. Now it's time to rise against them. We're sick of your treason. Sick of your lies. Fuck no, we won't listen. We're gonna open your eyes. . [Chorus]. Frustration, domination. Feel the rage of a new generation. We're living, we're dying. We're sick and tired of relentless lying. Destroy, enjoy, your fuckin' world is our new toy. Dominate, eliminate. You're gonna feel the wrath, wrath of hate. You might also like[Bridge]. Fuck authority. Silent majority. Raised by the system. Now it's time to rise against them.
