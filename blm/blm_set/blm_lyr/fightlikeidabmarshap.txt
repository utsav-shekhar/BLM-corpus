. [Verse 1]. They ain’t never showed no love. Like the world against us. Bein' born with no luck. In mourning and stuck. Fight the power like Chuck. Rage against the machines. And not giving fucks. Paint us all with one slug. We know war on the drugs. Mean war on "Black thugs". Politicians just shrug. Ain’t no help from above. [Chorus]. They don’t wanna see us. Up, up, up , up , up , up. Let my niggas grow. Up, up, up , up , up , up. Everybody fists. (Marsha P Johnson was a freedom fighter and she taught us how to fight). Up, up, up , up , up , up. Er'body go. (Ida B Wells was a freedom fighter and she taught us how to fight). Up, up, up , up , up , up. They don’t wanna see us. . Y'all need to stop being racist (We ready, we coming). Y'all need to stop being anti-Black (We ready, we coming). Y'all need to stop killing black people (We ready, we coming). Black Lives Matter, All Black Lives Matter (We ready, we coming). We right here, we standin' up, we ain't goin' nowhere, c'mon. . [Verse 2]. Uh. I got bodily autonomy. And its policy is people over property. Treat us like pieces of monopoly. One day you'll be nothing but the rich to eat. Uh, Defund the police. Abolish the prisons, or don't speak a word to me. Stop ICE and let 'em all free. Let the kids be, end intersex surgeries. The dollar that enslaved us cannot save us. The cop that killed Mike Brown is not a savior. Y'all be treatin' laws like religion. I ain't come here to play woke musician. I don't say "we gon' win" for the listens. Niggas tired of all the Twitter feed lynchins. Free up all my trans siblings in prisons. Why they steady punchin'  down?. You might also like[Chorus]. They don’t wanna see us. Up, up, up , up , up , up. Let my niggas grow. Up, up, up , up , up , up. Everybody fists. Up, up, up , up , up , up (We ready, we coming). Er'body go (We ready, we coming). Up, up, up , up , up , up (We ready, we coming). . Black womens' lives. Black trans lives (Say what?). Black girl lives. Black intersex lives (Say what?). Black queer lives. Black Muslim lives. Black disabled lives. Black mens' lives (Say what?). . Up, up, up , up , up , up. Let my niggas grow. Up, up, up , up , up , up. Everybody fists. Up, up, up , up , up , up (We ready, we coming). Er'body go (We ready, we coming). Up, up, up , up , up , up (We ready, we coming). Harriet Tubman was a freedom fight. And she taught us how to fight. Charlene Carruthers is a freedom fighter. And she taught us how to fight. Mia Henry is a freedom fighter. And she taught me how to fight. . Whose side are you on, my people?. Whose side are you on?. Whose side are you on, my people?. Whose side are you on?. . [Crista Noel: Outro]. I am the revolution. And the revolution don't stop. I am change. Soon we will make a change that will change it all. I am courage. Courage to move the masses forward against those that will sit and stay and not move. I am movement. Moving all the place where we will be judged by content of our character and not the color of our skin. I am my skin. Color of my people who toiled the land of America and made it great. I am great. Great because I dedicate myself to change. I dedicate myself to my people. I dedicate myself to the movement. I dedicate myself to the revolution. And the revolution don't stop1Embed
