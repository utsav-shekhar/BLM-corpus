Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no. No no. . [Verse 1: Eden]. I look and stare so deep in your eyes. I touch on you more and more every time. When you leave I'm begging you not to go. Call your name two, three times in a row. Such a funny thing for me to try to explain. How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame. 'Cause I know I don't understand. How your love can do what no one else can. [Chorus: Eden]. Got me looking so crazy right now. Your love's got me looking so crazy. Got me looking so crazy right now. Your touch got me looking so crazy right now. You got me hoping you'll page me right now. Your kiss you got me hoping you'll save me right now. Looking so crazy, your love, you got me looking. Got me looking so crazy, love. . [Bridge: Eden]. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no. Uh oh, uh oh, yeah, yeah. . [Verse 2: Leah Kelly]. When I talk to my friends so quietly. "Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me. Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress. If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress. It's the way that you know what I thought I knew. It's like a beat in my heart skips when I'm with you. But I still don't understand. Just how your love can do what no one else can. . [Chorus: Eden and Leah Kelly]. Got me looking so crazy right now. Your love's got me looking so crazy. Got me looking so crazy right now. Your love's got me looking so crazy right now. Got me hoping you'll page me right now. Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now. Looking so crazy, your love, you got me looking. Got me looking so crazy, your love. [Verse 3: Eden and (Leah Kelly)]. Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco. (Got me looking, so crazy,). Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh. (my baby). O.G. big homie, the one and only. (I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish,). Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano. (I don't do this, I've been playing myself,). The ROC handle like Van Exel. (baby). I shake phonies man you can't get next to. (I don't care). . [Verse 4: Eden and Leah Kelly]. Your love's got the best of me. Baby you're makin' a fool of me. You got me sprung and I don't care who sees. 'Cause baby you got me, you got me, you got me. Oh, baby you got me, you got me, you got me. WOAH!. . [Chorus: Eden and Leah Kelly]. Got me looking so crazy right now. Your love's got me looking so crazy right now. Got me looking so crazy right now. Your touch got me looking so crazy right now. Got me hoping you'll page me right now. Your kiss you got me hoping you'll save me right now. Looking so crazy, your love, you got me looking. Got me looking so crazy, your love. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no, oh. No no, oh6Embed
