They call it creeping, I say loving, it's the only way for me. Filling out papers, signing waivers but I stay outside his reach. I name your mother and your father and the first pet that you keep. I know your favourite place to dine at when your cheque comes in each week. I know you do your wash on Sundays and you separate your whites. and that your car needs a new tire 'cos last week I laid those spikes. I've got a million polaroids with all the dates penned in red ink. I sneak a walkie-talky in your room to listen to you sleep.... . [Chorus]. You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same. One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything. We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part. Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart. [Verse 2]. Some call it stalking, I say walking just extremely close behind. I'm sure if I sat down and asked you, well you really wouldn't mind... You've got those eyes that drive me crazy, and I've got eyes to watch you sleep. I brought a pack lunch and some coffee for my stakeout in your tree... outside your house... shhhh. gotta be as quiet as a mouse, or else you'll call the police. And I'll get done for somethin' stupid like disturbance of the peace. and piece by piece I am collecting all the things you leave behind. and when you don't I rummage through your bins to see what I can find.... . [Chorus]. You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same. One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything. We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part. Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart. . You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same. One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything. We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part. Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart15Embed
