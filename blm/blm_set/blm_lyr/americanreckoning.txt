America's on fire. There's protests in the street. Her conscience has been looted. And her soul is under siege. Another mother's crying, as history repeats. I can't breathe. . [Verse 2]. God damn those 8 long minutes. Lying face down in cuffs on the ground. Bystanders pleaded for mercy. As one, cop shoved a kid in the crowd. When did a judge and a jury. Become a badge and a knee. On these streets?. [Chorus]. Stay alive, stay alive. Shine a light, stay alive. Use your voice and you remember me. American reckoning. . [Verse 3]. I'll never know what it's like. To walk a mile in his shoes. And I'll never have to have the talk. So it don't happen to you. Three little words written 'cross the chest. Of a twelve year old who hasn't lived life yet. "Am I next? Am I next?". . [Chorus]. Stay alive, stay alive. Shine a light, stay alive. Use your voice and you remember me. American reckoning. . [Instrumental Break]. . [Bridge]. Is this a moment or movement?. Is this the tide or a flood?. Is our American reckoning?. Our story written in blood. Or in love. Or in peace. You might also like[Chorus]. Stay alive, stay alive. Shine a light, stay alive. Use your voice and you remember me. . Stay alive, stay alive. Shine a light, stay alive. Use your voice and you remember me. American reckoning. In our American reckoningEmbed
