Ieuan. . [Verse 1: Ieuan]. West coast diamond. That's how you know that you're shinin'. The ups, the downs. They don't mean nothing when you're around but. L.A. with a couple of shawties. Tonight we're looking to party. Nothing exists when you're looking like this on some 80's shit. [Chorus: Ieuan]. But we gon' ride the wave. You're tripping if you think I give a fuck 'bout what they're sayin'. You're mine, all mine so stop that shit, stop playin'. Shot after shot, we'll be drinkin' all night 'til we sayin'. I love it when you love me. . [Post Chorus: Ieuan]. I love it when you love me. I love it when you love me. I love it when you love me. I love it when you love me. . [Verse 2: Jesse Saint John]. My baby tastes like something stronger than my pride. I tip the seat back in the passenger side. Now I can tell the difference from his lips and mine. When he's sippin' mine. Damn it, oh damn it, It's Sharon stone basic instinct. Now throw that ass like frisbee. Windows will keep it discreet. Mix Gatorade and Whiskey. And if I'm dreamin' I don't wanna wake up, wake up, wake up. No, baby, I don't wanna, wanna wake up. . [Chorus: Ieuan]. But we gon' ride the wave. You're tripping if you think I give a fuck 'bout what they're sayin'. You're mine, all mine so stop that shit, stop playin'. Shot after shot, we'll be drinkin' all night 'til we sayin'. I love it when you love me. You might also like[Post-Chorus: Ieuan]. I love it when you love me. I love it when you love me. I love it when you love me. I love it when you love me. . [Chorus: Ieuan].
