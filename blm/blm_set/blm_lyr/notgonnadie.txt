Death surrounds. My heartbeat’s slowing down. I won’t take this world’s abuse. I won’t give up, I refuse. This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken. This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen. When everything you love is leaving. You hold on to what you believe in. . [Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]. The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye. And then I heard you flatline. [Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]. No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna stand and fight forever. Don’t close your eyes. No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna fight for us together. No, we’re not gonna die tonight. . [Verse 2: John Cooper]. Break their hold. Because I won’t be controlled. They can’t keep their chains on me. When the truth has set me free. This is how it feels when you take your life back. This is how it feels when you finally fight back. When life pushes me I push harder. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger. . [Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]. The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye. And then I heard you flatline. . [Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]. No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna stand and fight forever. Don’t close your eyes. No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna fight for us together. No, we’re not gonna die tonight. You might also like[Bridge: John Cooper]. Don’t you give up on me. You’re everything I need. This is how it feels when you take your life back.

No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna fight for us together. No, we’re not gonna die tonight. . [Ending: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]. No, we're not gonna die tonight. Not gonna die. Not gonna die.
