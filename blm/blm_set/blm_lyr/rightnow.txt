Tear down. These  walls. Well  this can't go on forever. Something's gotta give. . [Verse 1]. How can I relate to a world I feel is broken. To  the minds that I feel won't open. And  how can I speak life. When all I see is death and all I see is strife. Yeah,  I'll tell them. [Pre-Chorus]. Look into their eyes. Listen to their cries. Voices speak demise. . [Chorus]. Tear  down. These walls. Well this can't go on forever. Something's gotta give. Burn down. And relearn. Well we won't be here forever. Something's gotta change. Right now. Right now. Right now. . [Verse 2]. How can we exist in a constant state of crisis. Society in conflict. All the ignorance betrays a weakness. Too much pride to admit there's a sickness. Vacant emotions. Like walking corpses. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. Look into their eyes. Listen to their cries. Voices speak demise. . [Chorus]. Tear down. These walls. Well this can't go on forever. Something's gotta give. Burn down. And relearn. Well we won't be here forever. Something's gotta change. Right now. Right now. Right now. Right now. . [Bridge]. If we all take a second and listen. Voice of reason is how we can end this. We can't waste a minute. It needs to happen now. Drop your weapons and all your defences. Drop your pride get the point that we're missing. We can't waste a minute. It needs to happen now. It needs to happen now. [Chorus]. Tear down. These walls. Well this can't go on forever. Something's gotta give. Burn down. And relearn. Well we won't be here forever. Something's gotta change. Right now. Right now. Right now. Right now1Embed
