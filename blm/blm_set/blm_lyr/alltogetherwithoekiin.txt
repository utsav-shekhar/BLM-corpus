You can go ahead and judge me. Just  so you can say you're right. You  can try to rise above me. But what's underneath is your own lies. You can choose to understand me. Or  refuse to see the other side. Go  and call me the enemy. While I'm only trying to save your life. . [Pre-Chorus]. When  a war with each other. Is a war against ourselves. We both lose when we start the fight, oh no. [Chorus]. No proof of God above me. I  only know what I see. And we can only help ourselves. All together. . [Drop]. All together. All together. All together. All together. . [Verse 2]. You can try to separate us. Draw a border with your mind. You can say that we are different. When we want the same to survive. When religion and leaders still remain in between us. We all lose if we can't align, oh no. . [Chorus]. No proof of God above me. I only know what I see. And we can only help ourselves. All together.
