Movin' kinda free. Movie in the making. So I’m moving like me. Like Neo. Making love to his trio. She feel how I do it. Rock her world like I’m Geodude. Hearts the avalanche. Feeling kinda Rocky. Lyrical flex type of cocky. So I put it in your face like that. Mental muscle is a fist and a jab. Wits the uppercut that’ll land like Zab. Fisticuffs got me feeling tonka tough. Cause the child like minds. Always inventing stuff. Take the raps of 3 Stacks. With Tabasco and Fiasco on that. This is a Game for Blaine. But ain’t no E in that. Look it up. Gotta kill it how I feel it. How I’m feeling with my feelings. I mix it with the hypnosis. Just me being me. Today I’m feeling free. Whenever I flow free. Im flowing the with the energy. Lost my mind. Found the mental madness. Diagnosis the manic. Now I’m a alchemist of magic. I dwelled on the sadness. Now the dames make orgasmic. He has a plan for us. Just meditate the tactic. 3 months on a crater. Tryna meet my maker. Came back to the now. Just like a Terminator. Stop huggin my jawbreakers. My lines are like now-and-laters. In a Superman cape. But the damsel, yal can save her. You might also likeBudweiser. But the buds been retired. Enjoy a good high. But now I prefer the fire. Pyromaniac. Metaphors create brushfires. Check the waves. Double entendres start wildfires. Not Dylan. But I spit hot fire. My Dicks Grayson. Yeah I need that Starfire. Comic relief. Tongue in cheek. Like Trick Daddy and a freak. Off the Henny. A nigga could do Hennything. . Next time. I’ll just give her the vibrator. Meaning I check her vibe. And not pillow talk my life. Cause she probably got loose lips. If I hit it on the first night. Mouth shut, no secrets squealed. Even If the P*ssys tight. I got a grip on my vice like vice grips. If I fell off, that was just a slight slip. Must of fell off, right on to a rocket ship. I make moves, yal just steady mocking it. I’ll take the stewardess. You can have the cock pit. What’s the need for a pilot. If you can’t do fly shit. A king serves the public. Tyrants send the privates. I said I spit hot fire. Similar to fire hydrants. I’m so absurd. Moving birds. In the form of words. And moving verbs. At the pace of light. Speeding at the speed of sound. Bout to take flight. I clip wings. And leave a sting. Like Ali. On fight night. . I shadow box. When I’m having writers block. Fighting with my past. Left me with all kinds of knots. If a string has a knot. Patience will untie it. Patience can do a lot of things. Have you ever tried it. . Spewing all this venom out my system. Bout to turn this rental to a motherf*ckin lemon. Bitter decisions. Makes for bittersweet wisdom. Past is 20/20. With the Visine missin. . Yeah I hurt. So I do this til I hurt not. Finish product is Black Panther. Cutting lines is like Hurt Lock. Bitter ambition. But I don’t let the shots enter me. I flow out my mind. Then Im flowing into memory. This is muscle memory on display in this track. Give me them 45 plates. And I’ll lift them in these raps. Isolate the biceps. Then I lock up the wrist. Cooking up a batch. Of that dope sh*t yal call lyrics. Flying how I fly. Fly all the time. Flying like Gemini. Right into the eye. Of the storm. Then the eye. Of the divine. For the Creed. All with divine minds. Look at what I see. Kinda truant, Mastermind. Never late to this. . Out my mind. Kinda like a Exodus. Opposite vision of what we call a pessimist. In my Prime. Moving like Optimist. I rhyme lines. With my optics to the finish line. Just to shine in no time. And on timelines. Illusion to free minds. Here in free time. Or a brain wash. Cause you can’t stop Shaun. . Let it breathe. With the Chi. This is me, puffin me from the inner me. . Get it twice. Get it three times. Put it with the rhymes. And I'll make ya go blind. With the shine that I emit. This is what I equip. With the God given gift. Yeah I spit it with this witEmbed
