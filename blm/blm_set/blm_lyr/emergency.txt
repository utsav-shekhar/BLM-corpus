Should I do what they gave me, took it and never admit. I invented the flow, yup, they different between us. Emergency come, like a different nigga. Different strokes, for different folks, shit I ain't tryin'. To come up short, let on, let it all. Or will it just blow, like it did to coke. Not me, some of us get rich, but 90 percent of us niggas is broke. The government, shit they make us sniff' coke. Instead of embracin' us, fuck savin' us, thinking what's ya throat. I'm hearin' ya guns in ya hood, what the fuck you think. How can one another --- get ya stoned and then some weed. Just go, eight children broke, the statistics, every three hours. A brother is smoked, a baby is killed, a sister is raped. Somebody mother, strangled under that dope. Just get up and say, here, get up and pray. Tomorrow and promise, so I live for the day, just for hip hop. I need all retired rappers to come back, yea. We work too hard, to give us away, evicted my age. I can't grow up, like Eazy-E, a victim of AIDS. Being black is crime, I done worked, a nine to five. For three years, and they still, ain't give me a raise. Shit give me a gauge, fuck a mininum wage. Get in a helicopter, look down, shit we live in a maze. The day go fast, when ya broke, but it seems like. The minute you pay, the sun, never set. I don't sleep, cuz sleep is the cousin of death. So I wake up, my brother, my cousins, and uncle's that's def, yes. *talking*. . [Bugs]. After the war, there's casualties, I stood the art. They give us roaches and batteries, and blow you apart. Peon, procrastinate, to assassinate under the smart. Be brave, in the Wizard of Oz, they build you a heart, get some courage. Or get you the light, most flow in the dark, won't get discouraged. I'm on the one way trip to heaven, forget the luggage. Just in pain, it's making me weak, it's making me sluggish. Besides me, hogging up my THC. In my hood, everybody got a PHD. I count on my fingers, how many niggas got a GED. My life done work more, than TV, and the DVD. Fuck a CD, I wanna be free, money for free. I'm like a cat, caught in the tree, ok, I need help. Why do I do for others, when I know, that you ain't do shit for me. You be there when you need me, they collapse. Under the real woods, in me, if I need, another match. I chuckled, pool game, goodie mob, goodie help. Coke kid, frankly, GNC, respect yes. My brother Kenny, I will pay you back, forever you help me. I got the many mentions, it's yours, nigga the key to the drawers. So I work out, try to keep my endurance. We lips, looked out, when that nigga needed insurance. Lift it, G to E-N-T, Miss Pam, fuck feedin missy. I can cut down, for going to college, believing in me. I love you girl, you mean the world to meYou might also likeEmbed
