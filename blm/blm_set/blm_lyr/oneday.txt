Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha. Am-aba-ah-ah-oh-oh. (One day, one day, one day). Am-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh. . [Verse 1]. Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing. Then I pray, "Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason". . [Pre-Chorus]. Sometimes in my tears I drown. But I never let it get me down. So when negativity surrounds. I know some day it'll all turn around, because.... [Chorus]. All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for. For the people to say. That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars. And our children will play. One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh). One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh). . [Verse 2]. It's not about win or lose, 'cause we all lose when they feed. On the souls of the innocent, blood-drenched pavement. Keep on moving though the waters stay raging. In this maze, you can lose your way (Your way). It might drive you crazy, but don't let it phase you, no way (No way). . [Pre-Chorus]. Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown). But I never let it get me down (Get me dow-own). So when negativity surrounds (Surrounds). I know some day it'll all turn around, because.... . [Chorus]. All my life I've been waiting for (Waiting for). I've been praying for (Praying for). For the people to say. That we don't wanna fight no more (Fight no more). They'll be no more war (No more war). And our children will play. One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh, one day). One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh). You might also like[Bridge]. One day this all will change, treat people the same. Stop with the violence, down with the hate. One day we'll all be free, and proud to be. Under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like:. Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh. (One day, one day, oh-oh-oh). Why-ohhh, why-ohh-ohh-ohh. (One day, one day, oh-oh-oh). . [Chorus]. All my life I've been waiting for. I've been praying for. For the people to say (Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-oh). That we don't wanna fight no more (Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-oh). They'll be no more war. And our children will play. (Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh). One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh). (Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh). One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh). . [Outro]. Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha.
