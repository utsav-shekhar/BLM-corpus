I can't help who I am (I am). I just don’t give a damn. The smoke, it helps me forget (forget). The pain I haven't felt yet. Don't care what you say. Don’t care what you think of me. Trouble in my veins, suddenly the enemy is me. . [Chorus]. I wanna get high and a little fucked up (little fucked up). I only get by with a little bad luck (little bad luck). I can barely keep my cool, playin' by the golden rule. I can get by with a little bad luck (little bad luck). [Drop]. (I can get by with a little bad luck). . [Verse 2]. I, I'm lost in a dream (a dream). These friends, they're not what they seem. And I'm cryin' like a baby. My momma's out to save me but. I'm so far gone. . [Chorus]. I wanna get high and a little fucked up (little fucked up). I only get by with a little bad luck (little bad luck). I can barely keep my cool, playin’ by the golden rule. I can get by with a little bad luck (little bad luck). . [Drop]. (I can get by with a little bad luck). . [Bridge]. Some days, some days, I’m better off alone. Sad ways, sad days, this wagon's up and gone. Ring around a rosie, a pocket full of posies. Ashes, ashes, we all fall down. . [Chorus]. I wanna get high and a little fucked up (little fucked up). I only get by with a little bad luck (little bad luck). I can barely keep my cool, playin’ by the golden rule. I can get by with a little bad luck (little bad luck). You might also like[Drop].
