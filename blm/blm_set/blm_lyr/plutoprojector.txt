The great protector. Is that what I'm supposed to be?. What if all this counts for nothing. Everything I thought I'd be?. What if by the time I realize. It's too far behind to see?. Seventy-mil projector. I can show you everything, yeah. And we're on our way to glory. Where the show won't ever end. And the encore lasts forever. And it's time we're due to spend. [Verse 2]. Spending the years together. Growing older every day (Every day). I feel at home when I'm around you. And I'll gladly say again. I hope the encore lasts forever. Now there's time for us to spend. And it's sublime with you, my friend. This right here still feels like a honeymoon. When you say my name, nothing's changed. I'm still a boy inside my thoughts. Am I meant to understand my faults?. . [Chorus]. I don't think so. I don't think I'm meant to understand myself. Maybe you do. And that's good for you. Maybe in time. Maybe one day. I'll do the same. (I'll do the same. I'll do the same. I'll do the same). . [Bridge]. I'll do the same as you. I'll try and hold it up. Soon I hope. Or as soon as I'm old enough. (Old enough to understand. Old enough to understand).

But there's probably just no need50Embed
