I'm scared of getting pulled over 'cause of someone else I look like. I'm scared of raising my voice 'cause everyone will think that I'm gonna fight. . [Pre-Chorus]. This world was made for them. This world was made for me. How am I supposed to exist. When a friend is an enemy. . [Chorus]. If I can't save my self. If it's all black and white. If I can't call for help. In the middle of the night. If I can't turn to god. And I can't turn to you. Who do I turn to?. Who do I turn to?. [Verse 2]. I'm tired of watching my kind be accused when they're young and they're innocent. I'm tired of turning on the news and wondering why it happened again. . [Pre-Chorus]. No ones putting out the fire. They only fan the flame. Tell me who's gonna. Make it right when the good ones are to blame. . [Chorus]. If I can't save my self. If it's all black and white. If I can't call for help. In the middle of the night. If I can't turn to god. And I can't turn to you. Who do I turn to?. Who do I turn to?. . [Bridge]. Who's gonna watch over me?. Who do I turn to?. Who's gonna watch over me?. Who do I turn to?. Who's gonna watch over me?. Who do I turn to?. Who's gonna watch over me?. Who do I turn to?. You might also like[Outro]. If I can't save my self. If it's all black and white. If I can't call for help. In the middle of the night. If I can't turn to god. And I can't turn to you. Who do I turn to?. Who do I turn to?Embed
