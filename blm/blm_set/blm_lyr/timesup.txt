Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. . Yuh. Time’s up, motherfucker. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. [Verse 1: Sampa, Krown]. Yah. It’s the return black excellence. Don’t sit next to us. Lay it down like scripture. Jah bless God invest in us. Blackface industry. Lying don’t invest in me. Only want the money off our backs. Like history. In the industry I’m not a slave on a record. I rose brave, call it blessings. Acute angle out the rat race. I keep from going under. Time ticking for families holding the spears. Deception is equity used to buy your melody, all I hear. . [Chorus]. I seen the industry. Kill dreams of a dreamer. Kill dreams of a dreamer. Kill dreams of a dreamer. Kill dreams of a dreamer. I seen the industry scheme. And it’s a killer. I seen the industry. Kill dreams of a dreamer. Kill dreams of a dreamer. I seen the industry scheme. And it’s a killer. It’s a master plan to break you. I’m the scheme. They the schemer. You might also like[Verse 2: Sampa, Krown]. Yuh. Time’s up. Black republic. Want all my work republished. How many times. I inspired your rhymes. Then you redubbed it. We the inspiration. We the motivation. Take our ideas and then you resell it. In variations. The hour glass I’ma crack it. The fatter the cream, the blacker the talent. I’m taking matters in hands. I’d rather challenge. The industry. Got no dignity. Putting my fam up. Next to me. Searching for their diversity. Nervous. You know that I can see. All is I see is a bunch of mechanical breakdown. Do it till the planet break down. On a mission to free ourselves. Verbally medicated put on the shelf. We not for sale neither asking for help. And I ain’t asking for help. We not asking for help. We not for sale. Not asking for help!. Not out to get you. Or in rage. We just searching for self. Go fuck yourself. Fuck the game. Fuck the playing. Fuck the aud-ience. Fuck the dance. Fuck the list. Fuck the ARIA’s. [Chorus]. Cos I’ve seen the industry. Kill dreams of a dreamer. Kill dreams of a dreamer. Kill dreams of a dreamer. And I’ve seen the industry scheme. And it’s a killer. And I’ve seen the industry. Kill the dreams of a dreamer. Kill the dreams of a dreamer. And I’ve seen the industry scheme. And it’s a killer. It’s a master plan to break you. I’m the scheme. And they the schemer. . [Refrain]. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. Tick. . [Outro]. Time’s up, motherfucker. Time’s up, motherfucker. Time’s up, motherfucker. Time’s up, motherfuckerEmbed
