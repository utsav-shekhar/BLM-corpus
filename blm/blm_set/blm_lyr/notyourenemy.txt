Rip up the roots you've sown. Judas kiss, for bliss. You've now become the foe. Don't reject me. I'm not your enemy. Face spawled, glass walls. Shattered. . Fuck you and your mule. I won't be the tool. For extracting this shit. What do you make of it?. Dry wit, won't cover all. Stall, forgotten your lines, did you?. Though composite, gin trap grip. On a false oasis. I'm on a roll. The rock is beaten back but I'm hardcore. The towel is thrown. But you're going down. . To see you fall. To see you crawl. Is worth every kind of agony. To see you fall. To see you crawl. Is worth every kind of agony to meYou might also likeEmbed
