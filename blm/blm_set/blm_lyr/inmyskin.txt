Passing time on the other side. So heavy and warm. Like a blanket of air. . A landscape of memories. Behind each sunrise. We are all leaves on the same branch. On the same burning tree. Sprouting leaves from my fingers. I see my body below me. Reaching out to ghosts hidden by time. Floating so deep I can hear the singing silence. A single murmur in the air between us. Between us... Between us. A new season takes hold. And a chill numbs my skin. . Aurora summons the light. And ghosts fade away. Listen to them quietly call me back. Shadows from another time. . Bury me deeper until tomorrow. Past unseen, hidden from my last day. When innocence falls away. For tomorrow I'll hear the mountains singYou might also likeEmbed
