I am black ambition. I am always whisperin'. They keep tellin' me I will not. But my will won't listen. Gravity on a black man. With everything on his back and. His family and passion. If the doors ain't crackin'. . [Chorus: Pharrell Williams]. You gotta let go (Let go). If you want to fly, take the leap. You gotta risk it all (Risk it all). Or they'll be lots of things you'll never see. You gotta let, let go. 'Cause you never know what's in store. Mister entrepreneur. [Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]. In this position with no choice. A system imprison young black boys. Distract with white noise. The brainwashed become hype boys. Third eye dilate. You wasn't supposed to make it off Sеction Eight. Robbin' Peter just to pay Paul. Preparе to risk everything. . [Chorus: Pharrell Williams]. You need let go (Let go). If you want to fly, take the leap. You gotta risk it all (Risk it all). Or they'll be lots of things you'll never see. Remember black is space. And its the color of your face. There will be no sunny days. If Black went away. . [Refrain: Pharrell Williams]. Black man, Black man, Black man. Black man, Black man, Black man. Black man, Black man, Black man. Black man, Black man, Black man. Black man, Black man, Black man. Black man, Black man, Black man.

Please stick to the drip that you're used to. They don't make them like they used to. You might also like[Verse 2: JAY-Z]. Uh, lies told to you, through YouTubes and Hulus. Shows with no hues that look like you do. Black Twitter, what's that? When Jack gets paid, do you?. For every one Gucci, support two FUBUs. Sippin' crip-a-Cola consumer and a owner, uh. 'Til we all vertically integrated from the floor up. D'Usse pourer, sip Ace 'til I throw up. Like gang signs 'cept I bang mines for both ya. Serial entrepreneur, we on our own. Stop sittin' around waitin' for folks to throw you a bone. If you can't buy the building at least stock the shelf (Word). Then keep on stackin' 'til you stockin' for yourself, uh. See, everything you place after black. Is too small a term to completely describe the act. Black nation, black builder, black entrepreneur. You in the presence of Black Excellence and I'm on the board. Lord Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord. God, God, God, God, God. Lord, yuh, God. . [Refrain: Pharrell Williams].
