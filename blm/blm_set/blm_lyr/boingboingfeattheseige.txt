Z-E-R-O-S, that's right. I pay way too much for my flights. I pay way too much on my clothes. I'm just too damn cool for these hoes. Someone please just hand me my phone. So I can get back into my zone. Everyone just leave me alone. I'm just way too lit for this. All I ever wanted was a handful of 100's. All I ever needed was a girl who could see the. Gold on my neck, boy, I ain't tryna flex. But I'm shinin' so hard, even blind people see it. Steppin' out the wagon, it's 200 thousand. Bright red paint, got it lookin' like a dragon. That's what you get from a hard day of trappin'. I'm lit, man, it's all just flashin'. Don't that shit sound familiar?. Lame-ass rhymes these rap dudes deliver. Can't trust y'all, I stay live, familiar, knock down walls. Nigga, break down the pillars, hands to the ceiling. Hands in the air, spread that wealth, throw them bands everywhere. Material shittin' on royalty. Suck this dick, baby, I'ma shoot gold in your hair. [Pre-Drop]. Turn errything up. Turn errything up. Turn errything up. Turn errything. Turn errything. . [Drop]. Turn err'thing. . [Verse 2]. Welcome to the land of the greed. Welcome to the home of the slave. Run up in your house while you sleep. What's the number to the muhfuckin' safe?. Niggas goin' from the cradle to the grave. You done fucked around and stumbled in the cave. 'Bout to go Django unchained. Girls do anything to get backstage. Turn err'thing up. Money ain't everything, but Pops taught me how to stack green up. Black King Tut. High school friends selling drugs out the same house where I grew up. That's how you really give back to your community. I don't settle for less than getting what I need. I know people that's locked up for only using weed. How did Hilary Clinton get immunity, huh?. Hahaha, I don't know why that's funny. Everyday is Halloween, huh?. Michael Myers, Jamie Lee, huh?. Freddie Kruger in your dreams, huh?. Load up clips and make a scene, huh?. They puttin' lies on the screen, black and gold everything. We going crazy, we jump around like marines. We rage against the machine, nigga, we the kings. You ready?. You might also like[Pre-Drop].
