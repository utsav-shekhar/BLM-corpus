Ghostworld. . [Verse 1: Ghostsocial]. And it's been a couple of years since I felt at home here. And there's no one near. And I've been tryna find a way to make it disappear. . [Chorus: Ghostsocial]. And I won't lie, I've been feeling this way for a long time. I can't ever look on the bright side. Inside, cutting ties just to waste time. Tell me all your problems, I can't even fucking face mine. We get high not to feel low. 'Cause I've been looking back, like, "Where the fuck did the time go?". Lately, feel like everybody hate me. I've been feeling fucking gone, fucking eighteen. [Verse 2: Dylan Longworth]. I was eighteen on the verge of a daydream. Contemplating all the choices I'm making. Lately, feel my heart steady racing. From all the smoke and drinking, yeah, it's making the pain sting. Stay up all night, get high 'til the sunshine. I know I've felt this way for a long time. Everybody hates me, it's no lie. I hope that if I die, I can finally see the bright side. . [Chorus: Ghostsocial]. And I won't lie, I've been feeling this way for a long time. I can't ever look on the bright side. Inside, cutting ties just to waste time. Tell me all your problems, I can't even fucking face mine. We get high not to feel low. 'Cause I've been looking back, like, "Where the fuck did the time go?". Lately, feel like everybody hate me. I've been feeling fucking gone, fucking eighteen. . [Outro].
