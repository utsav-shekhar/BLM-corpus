Birds flying high, you know how I feel. Sun in the sky, you know how I feel. Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel. . [Refrain]. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life for me, yeah. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life for me, ooh. And I'm feeling good. [Verse 1]. Fish in the sea, you know how I feel. River running free, you know how I feel. Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel. . [Refrain]. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life for me. And I'm feeling good. . [Verse 2]. Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know?. Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean. Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean. And this old world is a new world. And a bold world, for me. . [Bridge]. Stars when you shine, you know how I feel. Scent of the pine, you know how I feel. Oh, freedom is mine. And I know how I feel. . [Refrain]. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life for me. You might also like[Outro]. I'm feeling good!43Embed
