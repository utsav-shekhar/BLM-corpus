No time for rest. No pillow for my head. Nowhere to run from this. No way to forget. Around the shadows creep. Like friends, they cover me. Just wanna lay me down and finally. Try to get some sleep. [Pre-Chorus]. We carry on through the storm. Tired soldiers in this war. Remember what we're fighting for. . [Chorus]. Meet me on the battlefield. Even on the darkest night. I will be your sword and shield, your camouflage. And you will be mine. Echos of the shots ring out. We may be the first to fall. Everything can stay the same or we could change it all. Meet me on the battlefield. . [Verse 2]. We're standing face-to-face. With our own human race. We commit the sins again and our sons and daughters pay. Our tainted history. Is playing on repeat. But we could change it if we stand up strong and take the lead. . [Pre-Chorus]. When I was younger, I was named. A generation unafraid. For heirs to come, be brave. You might also like[Chorus]. And meet me on the battlefield. Even on the darkest night. I will be your sword and shield, your camouflage. And you will be mine. Echos of the shots ring out. We may be the first to fall. Everything can stay the same or we could change it all. Meet me on the battlefield. . [Pre-Chorus]. We carry on through the storm. Tired soldiers in this war. Remember what we're fighting for. . [Chorus]. Meet me on the battlefield. Even on the darkest night. I will be your sword and shield, your camouflage. And you will be mine. Echos of the shots ring out. We may be the first to fall. Everything could stay the same or we could change it all. (We can change it all). Meet me on the battlefield. [Outro]. Meet me on the battlefield. (We could change it all)8Embed
