Man in the red shirt. Comes from far land in the east. He has the brightest smile. And a saddest stare. . [Pre-Chorus]. He has the bleakest secrets to share. In a way that everyone would care. . [Chorus]. There goes a song from an Eastern Man. With his Tifa and a mouth like flower. There goes a song comes from deep within. His feeling 'bout his murdered family. By a loyal army. [Verse 2]. He plays it passionately. With the tune he borrowed from Marley. He mentions soils of gold. Now shattered by blood. . [Pre-Chorus]. He has the bleakest secrets to share. In a way that everyone would care. . [Chorus]. There goes a song from an Eastern Man. With his Tifa and a mouth like flower. There goes a song comes from deep within. His feeling bout his murdered family. By a loyal army. . [Bridge]. Sa pu mama mati karena tentara. Sa pu rumah hancur karena tentara. Sa su lama marah deng pemerintah. Dong su buat Papua menjadi merah. . [Chorus]. There goes a song from an Eastern Man. With his Tifa and a mouth like flower. There goes a song comes from deep within his feeling.
