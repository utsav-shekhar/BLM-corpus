Yeah, Haviah Mighty. Na, na, na, na, na, na. Yeah, A Tribe Called Red. Na, na, na, na, na, na. Aye, Odario. (Uh). One time for your mind, yeah, check it. . [Verse 1: Odario]. I need purpose, let me work it. I need peace like dreams need service. Now I'm amped up, lift my spirit up. Push the pedal to the metal on the regular. It's that hunger, down the rough road. I gotta levitate, I gotta Love Jones. I got smoke so thick you don't want none. Work the middle, just, work the middle now. Too hot, keep bouncin' on that anthem. On top, still black like Siakam. Keep risin', the vibe is alive, yeah. Get together, let's get together now. [Chorus: Haviah Mighty]. He told me wine up and down-na-na. (Wine up and down). You got the curve like the banana. (Curve like the bana). So fling it up, Cariba-na-na. (Up, Caribana). Di spirit young like Nirvana-na. (Ey, ey, ey). He told me wine up and down-na-na. (Wine up and down). You got the curve like the banana. (Curve like the banana). So fling it up, Cariba-na-na. (Up, Cariba-na-na). Di spirit young like nirvana-na. (Ey, ey, ey). . [Verse 2: Haviah Mighty]. Carnival season, this life for the books. I jump and I wave and I wine and I juke (Okay). I crumple the page of the time that I took. Giving all of my love to a lame in the height of the good, yeah. In the summer: where the fetes, I’mma find that block. Mi like to press pon it, mi like to wine and kotch. And I never played mas but I need to. Hold up, hope you know the raps is the team too. I just wanna jump up with my people, up. Never brukdown but the streets do. Never know love like you evil. Spotify streams got me peaceful, yuh. You might also like[Chorus: Haviah Mighty].

A Tribe Called Red with the major sound. Love your life (Ey) Love the fight (Ey). Rise above, we embrace the light. Me nah dealin' with no stress tonight. Just work the middle, just, work the middle now. You know down low's how we dip. You know I pop gold in my drip. You know I give my soul a lift. Let’s get together, let's get together now.
