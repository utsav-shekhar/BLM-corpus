White churches, black churches. Different people, same hearses. It's kinda hard to fight with each other. Layin' down in the ground six under. . [Pre-Chorus]. At every show I see my people. They ain't the same, but they're all equal. One love, one God, one family. [Chorus]. You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white. Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable. We ain't that different from each other, from one to another. I look around and see worldwide beautiful. . [Refrain]. Thank God, thank God, thank God. Thank God, thank God, thank God. Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God. Thank God, thank God, thank God. . [Verse 2]. Coast to coast, city to city. Reach out your hands if you're with me. Still got some work but we still got a dream. Every shade, every heart, come together and sing. . [Refrain]. Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God. Thank God, thank God, thank God (Woo). . [Chorus]. You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white. Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable. We ain't that different from each other, from one to another. I look around and see worldwide beautiful. You might also like[Interlude]. One love, one God, one family (One family y'all, come on).
