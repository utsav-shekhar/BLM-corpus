Jeff Bliss: "There are kids in here who don't learn like that, they need to learn face-to-face. You're just getting mad because I'm pointing out the obvious...". . Julie Phung: (mumbling) "No. 'Cause you're wasting my time...". . Jeff Bliss: "I'm not wasting your time. I'm telling you what you need to do. You want kids to come in your class, you want them to get excited for this? You gotta' come in here and you gotta' make 'em excited. You want a kid to change and start doing better? You gotta' touch his freakin' heart! Can't expect a kid to change if all you do is just tell him.". . [TiRon]. Some of us, some of us. Want a house on the hill and a fancy automobile, automobile. No bills and a bank account filled up. Filled up, filled up. In love with a love like love is real. Some of us wanna feel like Superman and shoot to kill. Bang, bang, bang. Some of us try to live just like saints. Say grace in case he's watching. Some of us just don't pray. Like it ain't no thang. Like the pain don't hurt. Workin' like we all alone. Am I the only one that feels like. [Chorus]. Who we, who we are. Is all we, all we are. We just wanna play on a big top stage underneath the stars. Merry-go round till it don't go. Might end, though we dont know. All I know is. It won't change if you don't change. Won't change if you don't change. . [Post Chorus]. 'Cause all we are is all we are. So all we are is all I be. 'Cause all we are is all we are. So all we are is all I be. 'Cause all we are is all we are. So all we are is all I be. So all we are is all I be. So all we are is all I be. . [Ayomari]. All of us (all of us). Grow up (grow up). Trying to find our space (our space). Trying to find our piece (our piece). Of a pie, of a friend, of a love, on-the-go. Some days you can feel out of place. Like you can't keep pace. Don't it feel like we in a race?. Like, it's me vs. you. Or, it's us vs. them. Acting like, if you win I lose. Like, we both can't win. So one of us might as well just give up. 'Cause around here we don't give out open hands. You can't believe that though. 'Cause it's just not true. 'Cause I know by myself I can go 85 or maybe do 150 with some help from you. Together we. Make it count. Gather all our wits about us. We can make it count. Even when it get difficult and doubt got you down. We're so 'bout it, 'bout it we find a way up out it, out it. We know life can get rowdy rowdy sometimes. But we don't let that stop us from trying. 'Cause if you give up you never know what you'll find. 'Cause if you give up you never know what you'll find. And that's true for all of us. Y'all in with all of us, we all in this. All together now (All together now). You might also likeWho we, who we are. Is all we, all we are. We just wanna play on a big top stage underneath the stars. Merry-go round till it don't go. Might end, though we dont know. All I know is. It won't change if you don't change. Won't change if you don't change. . [Outro]. 'Cause all we are is all we are. 'Cause all we are is all we are1Embed
