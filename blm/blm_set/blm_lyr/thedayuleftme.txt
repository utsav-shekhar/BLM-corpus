Day you left me, day you left me. Day you left me, day you left me. . [Verse 1]. I woke up in LA, I hella miss the bay, but I can't go, can't go home. 'Cause the boy of my dreams took everything from me, he took everything I own. I'm hungover and abandoned, never believe what happened, I almost cared. Now I'm laying here looking for the words to say but there is nothing left. . [Pre-Chorus]. Throw it up, watch it fall down slow. Sold my heart, don't know where to go. I came to see you to say hello. Well, you're wasted and now I know. [Chorus]. My love, can you feel my pain?. 'Cause you were the poison in my veins. My love, can you hear me screaming?. 'Cause I am still bleeding from the day you left me. . [Post-Chorus]. (Day you left me, day you left me, day you left me, day you left me). (Did you feel bad for the day you left me? Day you left me day you left me, day you left me). (Did you feel bad for the) Oh woah no, no. (Day you left me, left me, day you left me, left me, day you left me). . [Verse 2]. You spent the night in my bed, the next day you put a gun to my head. Pill bottles and broken cassettes, lord help me I'm trying to forget. 'Cause when I hear your name, I get nervous and I know that you are doing this on purpose. And I know that you find this funny and I know that you just want my money, my money, no oh no. . [Pre-Chorus]. So throw it up, watch it fall down slow. You bought my heart and you won't let go. I came to see you to say hello. Well, I'm wasted and now you know. . [Chorus]. My love, can you feel my pain?. 'Cause you were the poison in my veins. My love, can you hear me screaming?. 'Cause I am still bleeding from the day you left me. You might also like[Post-Chorus]. (Day you left me, day you left me, day you left me, day you left me). (Did you feel bad for the day you left me? Day you left me day you left me, day you left me). Oh woah no, no2Embed
