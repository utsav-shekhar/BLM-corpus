They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away. And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday. They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away. But if there is a God, we need Him now. "Where is your God?". That's what my friends ask me. And I say it's taken Him so long. 'Cause we've got so far to come. . [Verse 2]. Tell me, people. Why can't they say that hate is ten zillion light years away?. Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul?. Why must my color black make me a lesser man?. I thought this world was made for every man. He loves us all, that's what my God tells me. And I say it's taken Him so long. 'Cause we've got so far to come. [Chorus]. But in my heart I can feel it, yeah. Feel His spirit, whoa whoa, whoa. Feel it, yeah. Feel His spirit. . [Verse 3]. I can't say that heaven is ten zillion light years away. But if so let all be pure at heart. Just to walk her righteous streets I pray. Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls. For those who don't believe will never see the light. "Where is my God?". He lives inside of me. And I say it's taken Him so long. 'Cause we've got so far to come. People, "Where is your God?". Inside, please let Him be. And I say it's taken Him so long. 'Cause we've got so far to come. . [Chorus]. But if you open your heart you can feel it, yeah yeah. Feel His spirit, whoa whoa, whoa. Feel it, yeah. You can feel His spirit. I opened my heart one morning and. I sho nuff could feel it, yeah yeah. Feel His spirit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can feel it, yeah. Feel His spirit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can feel it, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
