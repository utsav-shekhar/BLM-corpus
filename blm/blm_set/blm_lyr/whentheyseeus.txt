Rebel Life what I'm yelling. Niccolo Machiavelli. I'm a the Prince of the Nation. I bet the plot is to kill me. Ain't no thot that could feel me on this. Where art thou my Betty?. I'm just trying not to binge on my sins like buns to the belly. Taste that blacker the berry back when Halle was black barely. Them braids on Jada and Janet had a Nigga like wanna Marry. Dreams of having one braid standing up there's something bout Mary. But when never show nothing. I still stand up on my Jerry. Whats the deal with erections?. Man I swear they be petty. Cause we friends. But not really. I know your sins. And you'd kill me. If I shared mines with these women. If I shared minds you'd think different. I just feel that we vibe B.I.G. 95. In the drop, faith by his side. And fate not far behind. Bro gods, yelling lost tribe. When they see us riding by. Yea that's right. Throw that X high, let em know you ride or die. Jax Teller old lady type. Till I look the grim in eye. Say them words. You know that him and I. Aquemini. Used to call it that Aqua mani. So I'm willing to try. Santana bandannas out of circuit like Johnny five. I be in that turban red checkered like blow jihadist bombs. Type of style that might make you nervous to let me meet your pops. Baby stop, I'll get Fabrizio. And we'll have talk. I'ma be like Jay Z, your daughter she finna be with roc. Yea I got the juice, but it's really you that's gon set it off. Jason's lyric. Girl you know Joshua gotta shoot the shot. A different world that piccolo hat no snow boarder. Lena James come get this new black militant love. Africa colors on a brotha no colored Nigga. Hidden colors 1, 2, & 3, while we under covers. All I need in this world is another sinner to trust. With yo sweet smile, but I that know you like to play rough. [Hook: ?Lord AV]. So picture us like Pac and Jadas picture. Picture that. Can you picture that. . [Verse 2: Lord AV]. This the baby boy that never was. Im not a thug. I'm a militant. I'll take them slugs. To keep you good. I would sacrifice my life for yours. Put on the gloves. I'm a lover till I knuckle up. Don't give a fuck. You just gotta know this what you want. I'm not gon stunt. I ain't never had no better uh... Not a panther. But the power of the p I'm on the hunt. Elaine Brown type of woman that's just what I want. But I ain't the most conscious either I'm still growing up. I'm tryna lead at 26 and I got needs and ambition. I got no seed and who knows when. Cuz I out live my Nigga pac so ima live this out for him. Resurrect the Yummy Binghams. That have died before their time. Instead of Jesus we don't need him. Killuminati Cum Laude. Baby we Juliard good. But if I die from my drama. Don't sing they cooley high hook. Cause ain't no goodbye. Just do a kuqbar. A woman thats down for life and death. Yea I hope that you are. And before my last breath. Its F U, us against the world. I can see that tattoo on you. Like VVS stones and pearls. Got respect for your palace. Only drink from your chalis. A brother like me just needs balance. And that plays right to your talents. Forward, Guard, and center. Above the rim when I enter. Deep 85 percent mental. That mean that I be the truth. I'll take a bullet for proof. Tell lucifer shoot. Better hope that he got aim off the roof. Cause if he hit you. I'm skinning off his head with my boot. Gotta keep us on track. Got a Tyra. So run nigga run. And Never look back. Just be there when I pass the baton. New Black Militant god. JOSH MUHAMMAD, Lord AV. I'll be whichever you want. Just be my. Khadijah Farrakhan. Clara, Tynetta. Betty Shabazz. Power couple new era. Frank &  Claire shit. We bury Underwood who try end us. So get your camera. And look at us like we the descendants of pac & jada picture.
