Oh, hit it on the one, this world has come undone. Come on and sing it for everyone. Yeah, people, don't you quit, gotta show some heart and grit. You know we gotta put some soul in it. Hey, you know we gotta move, gotta get up and keep it true. Gotta pick it up and put it in the groove. Yeah, it's better to die on your feet, than living on your knees. Gotta get up, get up, get up, people. . [Chorus]. I'm talkin' 'bout hope. Talkin' 'bout love. Talkin' 'bout freedom. Like a soul sound system. I'm talkin' 'bout hope. Talkin' 'bout love. Talkin' 'bout freedom. Like a soul sound system. [Verse 2]. Hey, what's it gonna be? People, can't you see?. We need the freedom to be free. Yeah, your brotherâ€™s on his knees, your sister's beggin', please. Still, we act like war is peace. . [Chorus]. I'm talkin' 'bout hope. Talkin' 'bout love. Talkin' 'bout freedom.
