Yeah. The world is my expense. The cost of my desire. Jesus blessed me with its future. And I protect it with fire. So raise your fists and march around. Just don't take what you need. I'll jail and bury those committed. And smother the rest in greed. Crawl with me into tomorrow. Or I'll drag you to your grave. I'm deep inside your children. They'll betray you in my name. [Chorus]. Hey, hey. Sleep now in the fire. Hey, hey. Sleep now in the fire. . [Verse 2]. The lie is my expense. The scope of my desire. The party blessed me with its future. And I protect it with fire. . [Pre-Chorus]. I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria. The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer. The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima. The cost of my desire. Sleep now in the fire. . [Chorus]. Hey, hey. Sleep now in the fire. Hey, hey, hey. Sleep now in the fire. . [Verse 3]. For it's the end of history. It's caged and frozen still. There is no other pill to take. So swallow the one that makes you ill. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria. The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer. The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima. The cost of my desire. Sleep now in the fire. Yeah. . [Guitar Solo]. . [Outro]. Sleep now in the fire. Sleep now in the fire. Sleep now in the fire. Sleep now in the fire13Embed
