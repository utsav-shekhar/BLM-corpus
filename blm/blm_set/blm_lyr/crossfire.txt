He'd trade his guns for love. But he's caught in the crossfire. And he keeps wakin' up. But it's not to the sound of birds. The tyranny. The violent streets. Deprived of all that we're blessed with. And we can't get enough, no. . [Chorus]. Heaven, if you sent us down. So we can build a playground. For the sinners to play as saints. You'd be so proud of what we've made.

We just can't get enough, no. . [Chorus]. Heaven, if you sent us down. So we can build a playground. For the sinners to play as saints. You'd be so proud of what we've made. I hope you got some beds around. 'Cause you're the only refuge now. For every mother, every child, every brother. That's caught in the crossfi-. That's caught in the crossfire. . [Bridge].

Even when it cuts?. You might also like[Chorus]. So heaven, if you sent us down. So we can build a playground. For the sinners to play as saints. You'd be so proud of what we've made. I hope you got some beds around. 'Cause you're the only refuge now. For every mother and every child, every brother. That's caught in the crossfire (Woo). That's caught in the crossfire (Hey, yeah). . [Outro]. Who's caught in the crossfire? (Ah, oh). Who's caught in the crossfire? Baby, baby, oh. Who's caught on the cross?65Embed
