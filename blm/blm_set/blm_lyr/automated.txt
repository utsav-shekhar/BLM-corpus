. Fetty tall can't bag it. I don't like it how I had it. Now I hustle outta habit. Keep it comin' out of habit. Keep it comin' Automatic. Old girl kinda baddish. She can get it Automatic. Keep it comin' Automatic. Top notch call me cap-u-tan. You can tell by how I spend my time. I don't like it how I had it. Now I hustle outta habit. Keep it comin' outta habit. Keep it comin' automatic. Keep it comin' gotta Have it. Keep it comin' Automatic. . [Verse 1. . Keep it coming Automatic. People hate me it's a habit. They just hate cause I'm the baddest. Yeah they know that I'm a classic. When they see me they get spastic. Raising hell and reeking havoc. Got them running like some rabbits. Steal your girl cause I'm a magnet. . All the fake brothers abided me. Tell me off and they doubted me. Now they be asking to ride with me. Saying I'm chill brother I'd agree. . I'd agree. I'd agree. . Fake ass go make y'all some pottery. Better yet go win the lottery. Get on my level you mockery. . [Fake call based on a real call].
