My secrets are burning a hole through my heart. And my bones catch a fever. When it cuts you this deep. It's hard to find a way to breathe. . [Pre-Chorus]. But your eyes are swallowing me. Mirrors start to whisper. Shadows start to sing. My skin's smothering me. Help me find a way to breathe. [Chorus]. Time stood still. The way it did before I. It's like I'm sleepwalking. Fell into another hole again. It's like I'm sleepwalking. . [Verse 2]. I'm at the edge of the world. Where do I go from here?. Do I disappear?. The edge of the world. Should I sink or swim?. Or simply disappear?. . [Pre-Chorus]. But your eyes are swallowing me. Mirrors start to whisper. Shadows start to sing. My skin's smothering me. Help me find a way to breathe. . [Chorus]. Time stood still. The way it did before I. It's like I'm sleepwalking. Fell into another hole again. It's like I'm sleepwalking. You might also like[Bridge]. Wake up. And take my hand. Give me a reason to start again. Wake up. Yeah take my hand. Give me a reason to start again. . [Pre-Chorus]. Cause your eyes are swallowing me. Mirrors start to whisper. Shadows start to sing. My skin's smothering me. Help me find a way to breathe. . [Chorus]. Time stood still. The way it did before I. It's like I'm sleepwalking. Fell into another hole again. It's like I'm sleepwalking1Embed
