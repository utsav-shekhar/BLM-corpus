Getting edgy all the time. Someone around me just a step behind. It's kind of scary, the shape I'm in. Walls are shaking and they're closing in. Too fast or a bit too slow. Paranoid of people and it's starting to show. One guy that I can't shake. Over my shoulder is a big mistake. . [Chorus]. Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake. There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take. I think I'm on a roll, but I think it's kind of weak. Saying all I know is "I gotta get away from me". [Verse 2]. Tell you, something just ain't right. My head is on loose but my shoes are tight. Avoidin' my friends, they all bug. Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped. If you reason, don't you know. Your own preoccupation is where you'll go. Being followed, look around. It's only my shadow creeping on the ground. . [Chorus]. Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake. There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take. I think I'm on a roll, but I think it's kind of weak. Saying all I know is "I gotta get away from me". . [Post-Chorus]. I gotta get away from me. I gotta get away from me. . [Bridge]. Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh. Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh. . [Chorus]. Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake. There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take. I think I'm on a roll, but I think it's kind of weak. Saying all I know is "I gotta get away from me". You might also like[Post-Chorus].
