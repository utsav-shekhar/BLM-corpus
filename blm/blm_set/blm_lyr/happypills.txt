I take my pills and I'm happy all the time. I'm happy all the time. I'm happy all the time. I love my girl but she ain't worth the price. She ain't worth the price. No, she ain't worth the price. . [Verse 1]. We can go to my house if you wanna. Hang out in my bedroom, lose your honor. Even if they find us, we're apathetic. And they can't take that away. [Chorus]. I take my pills and I'm happy all the time. I'm happy all the time. I'm happy all the time. I love my girl but she ain't worth the price. She ain't worth the price. No, she ain't worth the price. . [Verse 2]. The voices in my right brain are kinda funny. They tell me "take a deep breath, it's always sunny". But where I leave the lights on. It's so obvious that my life's pretty plain. . [Chorus]. I take my pills and I'm happy all the time. I'm happy all the time. I'm happy all the time. I love my girl but she ain't worth the price. She ain't worth the price. No, she ain't worth the price. . [Bridge]. We take strange things to feel normal. We take strange things to feel normal. We take strange things to feel normal. To feel normal, to feel normal.
