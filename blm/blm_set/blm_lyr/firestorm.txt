Turn off the lights now. You don't have to go through a firestorm. Back up more patience. You won't find the answers above. Who will be banished?. And who has the courage to try some more?. To be in the glory you'll have to survive to your falls. . [Chorus]. It's too late to lose control. It's too soon to save your soul. You've already smashed your bones into the fire. [Verse 2]. Now hold your horses. Why do you have to go down that road?. Get back on your tracks. No good can resist so much wrong. How bad you want it?. And how bad you need what is not your fault?. No matter the story. Forever is not for so long. . [Chorus]. It's too late to lose control. It's too soon to save your soul. You've already smashed your bones into the fire. It's too late to lose control. It's too soon to save your soul. You've already smashed your bones into the fire. . [Bridge]. Lose control. Save your soul. You've already smashed your bones into the fire. Lose control. Save your soul. You've smashed your bones into the fire. You might also like[Chorus]. It's too late to lose control. It's too soon to save your soul. You've already smashed your bones into the fireEmbed
