When the walls fell. And the hungry child. Cried out for help. Did you hear the sound?. Did your heart break?. Does your heart break now?. . [Chorus]. Cannot feel it in my soul. Cannot see you I'm alone. Can the blind have sight, have sight?. When you see us all alone. Can you hear your people Lord?. Can the blind have sight, have sight?. [Verse 2]. When the man said. "You are choking me,". And he cried out. "I cannot breathe,". Did Your heart break?. Does Your heart break now?. . [Chorus]. Cannot feel it in my soul. Cannot see you I'm alone. Can the blind have sight, have sight?. When you see us all alone. Can you hear your people Lord?. Can the blind have sight, have sight?. . [Verse 3]. The world is burning. As You're standing by. Are you watching. As your children die?. Did your heart break?. Does your heart break now?. . [Chorus]. Cannot feel it in my soul. Cannot see you I'm alone. Can the blind have sight, have sight?. When you see us all alone. Can you hear your people Lord?. Can the blind have sight, have sight?. You might also like[Outro]. Does your heart break?. Does your heart break?. Does your heart break?. Does your heart break?. When the heart breaks. Does your heart break?Embed
