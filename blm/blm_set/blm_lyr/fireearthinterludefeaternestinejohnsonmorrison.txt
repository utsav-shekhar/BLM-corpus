I'm speaking, I'm speaking, okay?. Silent no more. The blood of our people arising from the shores. Ascending from the sand. Straight to our hands. Dripping from our fingertips. Yelling, kicking, screaming. And dreaming. See, they were here and know they're gone. And we didn't even have to say so long. Because they gave us the blueprint. Sat in, marched, slaughtered, and lynched for this shit. But we'd rather sit around, get money, clout chase, and gloat. Evеrybody got time, everybody want smokе. You can tweet and you can type, but did you motherfuckers vote?. I dare you to vote. I dare you to leave the trap. I dare you to learn more about your credit score. I dare you to know less about sports and own more houses and stores. Own some shit you could really call yours. 'Cause, news flash, it ain't really your hood if you ain't own no doors. I dare you to rap about anything but your pussy. Or how good you suck his-. How good you look and how tight your Fashion Nova fit. I remember when rap queens really used to spit. Like really used to kick shit. Would look you dead in the face and ask you, "Who you calling a bitch?". But now it's just so wet, how wet is it?. Is it as wet as our ancestors who were thrown overboat to drown, soaking wet?. Like sweat beads running down Harriet's neck?. Wet like immigrants swimming across borders until freedom?. Is it wet like Tamika Mallory's back as she marched down to Louisville, Kentucky for Breonna Taylor as she put her life on the front line?. Not knowing if it would be her last time. How wet is it?. 'Cause Breonna Taylor was here. George Floyd was here. Ahmaud Arbery was here. Rayshard Brooks was here. Ronald Green was here. Elijah McClain was here. Jamarion Robinson was here. And now they're gone. And we didn't even get the chance to say so longYou might also like1Embed
