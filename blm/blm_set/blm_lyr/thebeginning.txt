. [Intro]. Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating. Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms. As the world falls apart around us. All we can do is hold on, hold on. . [Breakdown]. Take my hand. And bring me back, yeah. [Verse 1]. I'll risk everything if it's for you. A whisper into the night. Tellin' me it's not my time and don't give up. I've never stood up before. This time, でも譲れないもの. 握ったこの手は離さない. . [Pre-Chorus]. So stand up, stand up. Just gotta keep, I wanna wake up, wake up. Just tell me how I can. "Never give up". 狂おしいほど刹那の艶麗. . [Chorus]. Just tell me why, baby. They might call me crazy. For saying, "I'd fight until there is no more". 愁いを含んだ閃光眼光は感覚的衝動. Blinded, I can't see the end. So where do I begin?. . [Verse 2]. Say not a word, I can hear you. The silence between us. 何もないように映ってるだけ. I'll take this chance and I'll make it mine. ただ隠せないもの. 飾ったように見せかけてる. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. So stand up, stand up. Just gotta keep, I wanna wake up, wake up. Just tell me how I can. "Never give up". 悲しみと切なさの艶麗. . [Chorus]. Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating. Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms. くだけて泣いて咲いて散ったこの思いは. So blinded, I can't see the end. Look how far we've made it. The pain I can't escape it. このままじゃまだ終わらせる事は出来ないでしょ?. 何度くたばりそうでも. 朽ち果てようとも終わりはないさ. So where do I begin?. . [Bridge]. 握りしめた失わぬようにと. 手を広げればこぼれ落ちそうで. 失うものなどなかった日々の惰性を捨てて. 君を. . [Chorus]. Just tell me why, baby. They might call me crazy (Crazy!). For saying, "I'd fight until there is no more" (No more!). 愁いを含んだ閃光眼光は感覚的衝動. Blinded, I can't see the end. Look how far we've made it (Made it!). The pain I can't escape it (Escape it). このままじゃまだ終わらせる事は出来ないでしょ?. 何度くたばりそうでも (Oh, wee-yeah!). 朽ち果てようとも終わりはないさ (Yeah!). It finally begins5Embed
