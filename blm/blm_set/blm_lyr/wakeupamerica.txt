I wanna learn what it's all about, but. Everything I read's global warming, going green. I don't know what all this means. But it seems to be saying. [Chorus]. Wake up, America. We're all in this together. It's our home, so let's take care of it. You know that you want to. You know that you got to. Wake up, America. Tomorrow becomes a new day. And everything you do matters. Yeah, everything you do matters in some way. . [Verse 2]. Stand up, I'll try if you will. Wake up, it's not a fire drill. All she needs is a little attention. Can you give her just a little attention?. Oh, it's easy to look away. But it's getting harder day by day. Everything I read's global warming, going green. I don't know what all this means. But it seems to be saying. (C'mon!). . [Chorus]. Wake up, America. We're all in this together. It's our home, so let's take care of it. You know that you want to (Wake up). You know that you got to (Oh). Wake up, America. Tomorrow becomes a new day. And everything you do matters. Yeah, everything you do matters in some way. You might also like[Bridge].

So, c'mon (Turn it up). . [Chorus]. Wake up, America (Wake up). We're all in this together. It's our home, so let's take care of it (It's our home). You know that you want to (Wake up). You know that you got to (Oh). Wake up, America. Tomorrow becomes a new day. And everything you do matters. Yeah, everything you do matters in some way1Embed
