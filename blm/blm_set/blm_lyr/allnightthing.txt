One, two, three.... . [Verse 1]. Waiting on the band to get started. Hardly room to stand, it's jammed, damn. Ooh, child, it's a crowd, now. People wanna dance. People wanna dance. Everybody wanna dance. Move their bodies round. While the music spins. Get down. Get down. Get down. Yeah.... Break out!. [Verse 2]. Freak on the floor. Freaks on the floor. All the freaks on the floor. All look starry-eyed. Disco whistles blow. Strange freaky vibes. Flashing lights. Of red, blue, yellow and green. It's a funky scene. Plenty for the head. Could only mean.... . [Chorus]. It's gonna be an all night thing. It's gonna be an all night thing. Baby, it's an all night thing. It's gonna be an all night thing. Yeah, yes it is. Uh-huh. Baby. . [Scat]. . [Verse 3]. Dig three-piece Slim-Jim movin' on in. On a chic freak. Come on in. No, I can't blow. Such a hot piece. Shooga booga, honey, could ya?. Move a little close. Close enough for you to hear. Baby, don't ya know?. You got me shifting in fifth gear. You look so fine, and. I want your number in my book. Gonna take you home with me. And get it on. All night long. You might also like[Chorus]. It's gonna be an all night thing. It's gotta be an all night thing. Baby, it's an all night thing. It's gonna be an all night thing. . [Outro]. All night thing, hello. Move that body, we can party. Everybody been hustling, working all night long. Hustling 9-5 all my life now today I'm gonna live my song. So glad it's Friday, no stopping this party. Move and groove, move and grove (Comin' through). Move and groove, move that move (Comin' through). (Let's go to the disco). (Let's go to the disco)Embed
