Who taught the sun. Where to stand in the morning. And who taught the ocean. You can only come this far. And who showed the moon. Where to hide till evening. Whose words alone can. Catch a falling star. . [Chorus 1]. Well I know my Redeemer lives. I know my Redeemer lives. All of creation testifies. This life within me cries. I know my Redeemer lives. Yeah. [Verse 2]. The very same God. That spins things in orbit. Runs to the weary. The worn and the weak. And the same gentle hands. That hold me when I'm broken. They conquer death to bring me victory. . [Chorus 2]. Now I know my Redeemer lives. I know my Redeemer lives. Let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. I know my Redeemer. . [Bridge]. He lives to take away my shame. And He lives forever I'll proclaim. That the payment for my sin. Was the precious life He gave. But now He's alive and there's an empty grave. . [Chorus 3]. And I know my Redeemer, He lives. I know my Redeemer lives. Let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. I know my Redeemer. You might also like[Outro]. I know my Redeemer lives. I know my Redeemer lives. I know that, I know that, I know that, I know that, I know. I know my Redeemer lives. (Because He lives I can face tomorrow). He lives, I know, I know, I know. He lives. (I spoke with Him this morning.). He lives. (The tomb is empty). He lives. (I'm gotta tell everybody)Embed
