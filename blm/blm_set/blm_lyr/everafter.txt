Once upon a time. I used to romanticize. Used to be somebody, never mind. Don't miss it that much now. I think it's sinking in. Days that I wonder where I've been. In picture perfect porcelain. But I won't lose a pound. . [Pre-Chorus]. You say I would make a better liar. I never face the music when it's dire. And I breathe disaster, ever after. Don't pull away from me now. [Chorus]. Don't you move. Can't you stay where you are, just for now. I could be your perfect disaster. You could be my ever after. You could be my ever after, after all. I could be your perfect disaster. You could be my ever after. . [Verse 2]. Apologies, I'm not myself but I can guarantee. That when I get back, you won't believe. That you knew me well. Don't want to think about it. I'm fuckin' tired of getting sick about it. Now stand back up and be a man about it. And fight for something, fight for something, fight for something, oh. . [Pre-Chorus]. I would make a better liar. I never face the music when it's dire. I breathe disaster, ever after. Don't pull away from me now. . [Chorus]. Don't you move. Can't you stay where you are, just for now. I could be your perfect disaster. You could my ever after. Now you could be my ever after, after all. I could be your perfect disaster. You could be my ever after. You might also like[Bridge]. Nobody told ya this is gonna fold ya. We'll go marching in like toy soldiers. To have and hold ya, oversold ya. Theyâ€™re marching like toy soldiers. . Somehow don't you dare fail, fail me now, ever after. Somehow don't you dare fail, fail me now, ever after. Somehow (Face the music when it's dire). (Face the music when it's dire). Somehow don't you dare fail, fail me now, ever after. Somehow. . [Outro]. Once upon a time. This place was beautiful and mine. But now it's just a bottom line. Barely comes to mind. But ever after was mine. . I'll be your disaster, ever after. So fire away. Goodbye5Embed
