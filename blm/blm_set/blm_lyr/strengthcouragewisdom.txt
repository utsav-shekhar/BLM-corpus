Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. . [Verse 1]. Inside my head, there lives a dream. That I wanna see in the sun. Behind my eyes, there lives a me. That I've been hiding for much too long. 'Cause I've been, too afraid to let it show. 'Cause I'm scared of the judgment that may follow. Always putting off my living for tomorrow. [Pre-Chorus]. It's time to step out on faith. I've gotta show my face. It's been elusive for so long. But freedom is mine today. I've gotta step out on faith. It's time to show my face. Procrastination had me down. But look what I have found. I found. . [Chorus]. Strength, courage, and wisdom. And it's been inside of me all along. Strength, courage, and wisdom. Inside of me (Yeah). . [Verse 2]. Behind my pride, there lives a me. That knows humility. Inside my voice, there is a soul. And in my soul, there is a voice. But I've been, too afraid to make a choice. 'Cause I'm scared of the things that I might be missing. Running too fast to stop to listen. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. It's time to step out on faith. I've gotta show my face. It's been elusive for so long. But freedom is mine today. I've gotta step out on faith. It's time to show my face. Procrastination had me down. But look what I have found. I found. . [Chorus]. Strength, courage, and wisdom. And it's been inside of me all along. Strength, courage, and wisdom. Inside of me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh. . [Pre-Bridge]. I close my eyes and I think of all the things that I wanna see. 'Cause I know, now that I've opened up my heart. I know that anything I want, can be. . [Bridge]. So let it be, so let it be. So let it be, so let it be. So let it be, so let it be. So let it be, so let it be. [Chorus]. Strength, courage, and wisdom. It's been inside of me all along. Strength, courage, wisdom. It's been inside of me all along, now every day I'm praying for. Strength, courage, and wisdom. To find, yeah, yeah, oh, oh. And it's been inside of me all along. Strength, courage, and wisdom. Inside of me. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, yeah. . [Outro]. I found it in me, and I found it finally. And I found it. I'm sure to keep it 'cause I like it, so I say thank you. I found it, oh, oh. I found it, hey, hey1Embed
