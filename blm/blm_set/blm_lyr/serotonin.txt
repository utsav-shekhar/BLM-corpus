Break the fuckin' mirror 'cause I hate the image. Every single tear I cry is wasted liquid. I fucked too many girls to count, I ain't commited. I guess bein' an asshole was a bad decision. . [Verse 2]. Thanks haters I love you. No one above you. I lost a thousand friends to threads, like where's the undo?. Tweetin' like I ain't affected by the hate directed every second, maybe I should take the weapon, blow. [Chorus]. Where are you going?. My serotonin. I'm feelin' alone and the world is so cold. It's hard to focus. Without oxytocin. Love is an ocean I can't control. . [Verse 3]. Break up with my girl because she doesn't trust me. I don't fuckin' blame her 'cause I trust in nothin'. Mama held a bottle, daddy doesn't hug me. All I ever wanted was someone to love me. . [Verse 4]. Thanks doctor I need those. Give me a free dose. I took a thousand happy pills but I'm still emo. Actin' like I ain't affected by the hate directed every second. Maybe I should fuckin' end it now. . [Chorus]. Where are you going. My serotonin. I'm feelin' alone and the world is so cold. It's hard to focus. Without oxytocin. Love is an ocean I can't control. You might also like[Outro]. Chemicals, chemicals in my brain. Where'd you go, where'd you go anyways?. Left a hole where the bad wants to stay. Everything, everything goes away. Chemicals, chemicals in my brain. Where'd you go, where'd you go anyways?. Left a hole where the bad wants to stay. Everything, everything goes away4Embed
