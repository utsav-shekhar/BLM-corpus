Do you hear me? I'm talking to you. Across the water, across the deep blue ocean. Under the open sky, oh my. Baby, I'm trying. Boy, I hear you in my dreams. I feel your whisper across the sea. I keep you with me in my heart. You make it easier when life gets hard. . [Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]. Lucky I'm in love with my best friend. Lucky to have been where I have been. Lucky to be coming home again. Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh, ooh-ooh. [Bridge: Colbie Caillat, Jason Mraz, both]. They don't know how long it takes. (They don't know how long it takes). Waiting for a love like this. Every time we say goodbye. (Every time we say goodbye). I wish we had one more kiss. I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will, I'm. . [Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]. Lucky I'm in love with my best friend. Lucky to have been where I have been. Lucky to be coming home again. Lucky we're in love in every way. Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed. Lucky to be coming home someday. . [Verse 2: Jason Mraz, Colbie Caillat]. And so, I'm sailing through the sea. To an island where we'll meet. You'll hear the music fill the air. I'll put a flower in your hair. Though the breezes, through the trees. You move so pretty, you're all I see. As the world keeps spinning 'round. You hold me right here, right now. You might also like[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]. Lucky I'm in love with my best friend.
