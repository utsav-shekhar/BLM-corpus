Cover my ears and close my eyes. Just long enough to stop the noise. Go on, take everything and throw it away. But I will use my voice. . [Refrain]. Woah, woah, oh. Woah, woah, oh. . [Verse 2]. Drown every truth in an ocean of lies. Label me "bitch" because I dare to draw my own line. Burn every bridge and build a wall in my way. But I will use my voice. [Chorus]. Woah, woah, oh. Whether you like it or not, you're gonna take what I got. Woah, woah, oh. If we can't talk about it, we'll just keep drowning in it. Give me credit or not, I give and I give a lot. But don't you speak for me. Woah, woah, oh. No, don't you speak for me. . [Verse 3]. Never mind me, I'm a waste of your time. Never gonna fit in the box that you need. And I can read between the lines, yeah. Gather your friends and wave your gun in my face. But I will use my voice. . [Chorus]. Woah, woah, oh. Whether you like it or not, you're gonna take what I got. Woah, woah, oh. If we can't talk about it, we'll just keep drowning in it. Give me credit or not, I give and I give a lot. But don't you speak for me. Woah, woah, oh. No, don't you speak for me. You might also like[Bridge]. Whether you like it or not. Whether you like it or not. Whether you like it or not. Whether you like it or not. One day soon. It's gonna fall back on you. No more lies. We're gonna break right through. Like it or not. . [Chorus]. Woah, woah, oh. If we can't talk about it, we'll just keep drowning in it. Give me credit or not, I give and I give a lot. But don't you speak for me. Woah, woah, oh. No, don't you speak for me. Woah, woah, oh (Whether you like it or not). Don't you speak for me4Embed
