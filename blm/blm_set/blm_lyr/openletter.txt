On a quest for the Holy Grail. Try and live on razor's edge. Find a mountain, or cross a valley. Why bother? It's all for sale. True love was in her eyes. Burning truth was on her face. Even though it was late at night. Saw her once, there's no mistake. . [Chorus 1]. Now that we've found this precious place. How do we keep from going crazy now?. My life was leading to this day. Watching the whole thing slip away. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise, anyhow. [Verse 1]. Dirty stains on brand new linen. Fresh tracks on virgin snow. Caught a saint while he was sinning. People scream, what do they know?. Turn it off and find religion. Tune it out and find a cause. Get it up and tell the world. Don't stop, don't ever pause. . [Chorus 2]. Here is this place from all our dreams. It doesn't seem to make us better now. If it will get us through the night. With all our conscience still intact. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise, anyhow. . [Chorus 3]. My life was leading to this day. Watching the whole thing slip away. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise, anyhow. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise. It's just a fool's paradise, anyhow. You might also like[Outro]. Two heads are better than one. Two hearts bleed so much more. Seriousâ€”but no one's laughing. Why run when you can crawl?. True love around the corner. Out of reach, so hard to hold. My life's an open letter. Tear it up, throw it away!Embed
