I woke up this morning, turned the TV on. And everything I see is everything that's wrong. And I'm like "Man, turn that off". Got enough to worry about without thinking 'bout this. Now my Twitter's blowin' up 'cause I spoke my mind online. Got no time for this. Reality is chasing me, my life is like a list. . [Pre-Chorus]. Wake up, wake up, get up, get up. Hustle, hustle, speed up, speed up. I start my day, take time to pray. No time to get to my haters. Wait, did I just say "haters"?. Not wastin' no bars on you. So much potential inside of me. And I'm taking my opportunity. [Chorus]. Today I will walk in my power. And today will be my finest hour. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. I live for me, I can't live for you. I have a dream, I have a dream and I do believe. . [Verse 2]. This is the last time (Last time). I let you play with my mind (My mind). 'Cause now I know better. Now my phone's blowing up 'cause I spoke my mind last night. Got no time for this. Is my heart still beatin'? (Yeah, my heart's still beatin'). I'm over you, I'm over you. Uh-uh, ain't nobody answering that. . [Pre-Chorus]. Wake up, wake up, get up, get up. Hustle, hustle, speed up, speed up. I start my day, take time to pray. No time to give to what's-his-name. Wait, did I just say "what's-his-name"?. Not wastin' my time on him. I know my king is out there for me. So I'll take my opportunity. You might also like[Chorus]. Today I will walk in my power. And today will be my finest hour. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. I live for me, I can't live for you. I have a dream, I have a dream. So today I will walk in my power. And today will be my finest hour. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. I live for me, I can't live for you. I have a dream, I have a dream and I do believe. . [Verse 3]. Woke up this morning, I pick up my phone. And see this crazy thing as I hear goin' on. And I'm like, "Hold up, they talkin' 'bout me". Got enough to worry about without thinking 'bout this. I've been black girl magic. 20 years I been at it. I'm over you, I got nothing to prove (Nothing to prove). Or maybe I do. Hollywood's sexist and racist. And still we smile throughout it. You'd be surprised what we doin'. The way we show up and kill shit. I love my brown skin so much. Been that way before Wakanda. So love what you thought or love me. And I, I'll never stop so. [Chorus]. Today I will walk in my power. And today will be my finest hour. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. I live for me, I can't live for you. I have a dream, I have a dream. So today I will walk in my power. And today will be my finest hour. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. No more coulda, shoulda, woulda. I live for me, I can't live for you. I have a dream, I have a dream, yeahEmbed
