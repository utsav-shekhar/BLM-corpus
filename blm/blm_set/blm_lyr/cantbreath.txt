Woke up and I laced my kicks. It's the. K-swiss still lace my liquor. With the cake mix. Got my lady pink she. Roll good like a 86. 'cedes benz I play the field. She play the pitch. MSN ASL your bae sent me pics. JPEGs and clips got um all saved I wish. Rude boy misbehave again. Eh. Champagne I piss. Only sip the grape with fizz. I don't ever celebrate shit. No. I don't ever celebrate shit. Uber be the getaway. Yeah Uber me the getaway whip. [Verse 2 - Kojaque]. Card or cash. You can count it out. Drive safe boss man fair play. You can keep the tip. Toe paint on me girl she a wavy chick. Pinky nail and a bag of powder playing lucky dip. Pass it out it's a party baby let me pay for it. Cash in out, automatic teller out of cash. Let my dealer pay me back on tick. One condition, that he get it fast. Come on man you know I'm good for it. In the chipper chopping up the cod-a-fillet with a silver platted steak knife. Baby livid I don't pay attention she just want attention cause its date night. Sick of wifey after day two. Now I see her in my brake lights. Seeing double off of grey goose. Triple Z'in in the day time. . [Pre-Chorus - Kojaque]. Walking round the city like I'm tryna shift some pills. Spending time with Brittany cause I got some time to kill. Why does she excite me. She don't have no fucks to give. She don't really like me. She just like the way I feel. Walkin' round your city like I'm tryna shift some pills. Spending time with Brittany cause I got some time to kill. Why does she excite me. She don't have no fucks to give. She don't really love me. She just like the way I feel.

Rocking CK's on the waist. Got you on lock like dreads. Poppin' the Pez. Sleep talk. Diva on the edge. Tees off. Sweet talk. She be like a ten out of... (ease off). Thing on my sleeve. Then I spend it again. 3 shots. Got me kissing my teeth. Henny with the San Pelly tipsy. With a Hello Kitty in the den. [Verse 4 - Kojaque]. Jenny saw me on the telly. Said she wanna get with my friend. Only 20 on me, I'm broke. That ain't get me back to my ends. Catch um on the run with the cava. Can't say nada. Feds wanna pat me down. With a lung full of the Rasta. Hands in the trunk of the Mazda. Can't breath out. I be on the phone to me Nana. Don't tell Ma but biddy can you bail me out. Posted and I'm straight back at it.
