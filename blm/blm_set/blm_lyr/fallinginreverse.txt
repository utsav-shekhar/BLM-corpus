So here's to you, and all the problems that we've made. And I know it's so hard to stay afloat. When you make monsters out of thoughts. And you're dragged under. And everyone in around you is too far away to notice. Your chest start to crush, oh, but it's alright. Oh, you'll be alright. So just breathe, it's almost over. And don’t let the monster in your head. Become your fears. 'Cause you can save yourself, you know. You know. [Verse 2]. So listen here, I know it's hard. Maybe I can't be what you want. But I'm just who I am, and I'm trying to be what you could need. And I am still here, that voice in your head. And I'll be there for you, when no one else cares. And this is it, as far as where we've got since then. So know a good thing when you got it. And I hope you know you don't go alone. . [Outro]. Come on, what’s the big deal? Nobody’s that heartless.
