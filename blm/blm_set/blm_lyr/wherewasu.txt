I ride around hittin' licks. With this smoke in my lungs. I swear that once upon a time. I wasn't trainin' with thugs. I was out in the A. Doin' shit, I'm not proud. Couldn't even tell my mama. I know she'd have a cow. Now I'm gettin' this money. Goin' the legal route. Born with hustlin' in my blood. My people out in a drought. So tell me, where is the love?. Baby where is the feeling?. Before I started gettin' money. People actin' like demons. Now hold up. [Pre-Chorus]. Cause I know, I know you see it now. I know. I know, I know. . [Chorus]. Where was you when I was hungry?. Where was you when I was all alone?. Where was you when I was lonely?. Cause now I'm gettin' it and everybody knows. Everybody knows. Cause now I'm gettin' it and everybody knows. So where was you when everybody hated me?. Cause now I'm gettin' it, I got it on my own. On my own. Alone. . [Verse 2]. These commas up on my mind. Always thinkin' 'bout M's. Lately I don't gotta try. This shit just keep comin' in. I got a safe with my watches. Watches, snatchers and thieves. Mama wanted a crib. I put her out on the beach. And it got dark for a minute. Even too dark for myself. The city took their time with Bear. I guess they sleepin' on me. So tell me, where is the love?. Tell me, where is the feeling?. Before I started makin' records. Boy this shit had a ceiling, but hold up. You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. Cause I know, I know you see me now. You see me now. And I know. . [Chorus]. Where was you when I was hungry?. Where was you when I was all alone?. Where was you when I was lonely?. Cause now I'm gettin' it and everybody knows. Everybody knows. Cause now I'm gettin' it and everybody knows. So where was you when everybody hated me?. Cause now I'm gettin' it, I got it on my own. On my own. Alone. . [Interlude]. Yo bro, just wanted to give you a call to update you on these label deals. We have to turn down another one. It is what it is. But you know what I always say: It just has to make sense. And maybe the lane makes no damn sense, so we do like we always do, keep on keepin' on 'cause these labels just want what we've been building, for so long. Alright?. . [Chorus]. Where was you when I was hungry?. Where was you when I was all alone?. Where was you when I was lonely?. Cause now I'm gettin' it and everybody knows. Everybody knows. Cause now I'm gettin' it and everybody knows. So where was you when everybody hated me?. Cause now I'm gettin' it, I got it on my own. On my own. Alone4Embed
