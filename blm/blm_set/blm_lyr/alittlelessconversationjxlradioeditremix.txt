Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me. Satisfy me, baby. . [Verse 1]. Baby, close your eyes and listen to the music. Drift through a summer breeze. It's a groovy night, and I can show you how to use it. Come along with me and put your mind at ease. Hey. [Chorus]. A little less conversation, a little more action please. All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me. A little more bite, a little less bark. A little less fight and a little more spark. Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me. Satisfy me, baby. . [Verse 2]. Come on, baby, I'm tired of talking. Grab your coat and let's start walking. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Don't procrastinate, don't articulate. Girl, it's getting late, getting upset waiting around. . [Chorus]. Yes, a little less conversation, a little more action, please. All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me. A little more bite, a little less bark. A little less fight and a little more spark. Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me. Satisfy me. . [Verse 2]. Come on, baby, I'm tired of talking. Grab your coat and let's start walking. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Don't procrastinate, don't articulate.
