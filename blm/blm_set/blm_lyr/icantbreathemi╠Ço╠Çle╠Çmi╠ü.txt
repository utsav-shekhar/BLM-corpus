Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Yeah, yeah. . [Verse 1: Young Adz]. Baby, my darling, don't wanna hurt feelings, but tell your man to wait inside when I pull up. Fifties and twenties, some lean and some flavours, go open my Louis bag, that's what it's full of. That pussy dripping, I just put my tip in, my tongue in her mouth while her pussy is full up. Still the same Adz that was beatin' up nitties and bringing them glizzys to go and pray jummah. [Chorus: Young Adz]. They can never understand, mm-mm. Heard that I'm a wanted man, mm-mm. I just count a hundred grand, mm-mm. Jakes come do the running man, mm-mm. DBE, top shotter, man, mm-mm. Cling and some rubber bands, mm-mm. Dotty in a duffel bag, mm-mm. Uptown, popping tags, mm-mm. . [Verse 2: Dirtbike LB]. Choker so tight, I can't breathe. £800 for my lean. £4000 for machines. £10,000 for my niece. Oh, baby girl, you a queen. Tryna get close to my deen. Praying Salah in Supreme. My brudda, Abdul Kareem. Hit a boy right in his beam. Yeah, oh yeah. . [Chorus: Young Adz]. They can never understand, mm-mm. Heard that I'm a wanted man, mm-mm. I just count a hundred grand, mm-mm. Jakes come do the running man, mm-mm. DBE, top shotter, man, mm-mm. Cling and some rubber bands, mm-mm. Dotty in a duffel bag, mm-mm. Uptown, popping tags, mm-mm. You might also like[Verse 3: Dirtbike LB & Young Adz]. Yeezy 700, girl, I'm not bothered. Racks in my wallet. Gelato 41 'til I'm coughin'. Tats on my face like I'm gothic. Still buying bricks for the profit. Run off on the plug like the running man, mm-mm. Run through a keg of adaan on my feet, ah. Baby girl, speak up. You even give a reply to a guy, I'ma leave ya. . [Chorus: Young Adz]. They can never understand, mm-mm. Heard that I'm a wanted man, mm-mm. I just count a hundred grand, mm-mm. Jakes come do the running man, mm-mm. DBE, top shotter, man, mm-mm. Cling and some rubber bands, mm-mm. Dotty in a duffel bag, mm-mm. Uptown, popping tags, mm-mm. . [Outro: Young Adz]. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darling. Baby, my darlingEmbed
