One, two, three, four. . [Verse 1: Sharon Van Etten]. Will the marker stain the skin?. Stole the dress I saw you in. Now nothing comes to mind. . Saw a life as override. One more session overdrive. The ceiling is the roof. [Pre-Chorus: Sharon Van Etten & Angel Olsen]. Change address and draw a line. Show my friends the silver line. Call my family just to know they're there. . [Chorus: Sharon Van Etten & Angel Olsen]. Sleeping in late like I used to. Crossing my fingers like I used to. Waiting inside like I used to. Avoiding big crowds like I used to. . [Verse 2: Angel Olsen]. Crawl the fiеld and let you in. Brand my heart I found you in. To say nothing's more apart. . Will my lovеr be there, stay. Follow them to less the pain. The ceiling must be wrong. . [Pre-Chorus: Sharon Van Etten & Angel Olsen]. Well, my head's gone today. Sell my past for a way. To sing and have something left to say. . Pray my hands, pray my voice. Give the reason, take away. Make believe an order for to stay. You might also like[Chorus: Sharon Van Etten & Angel Olsen]. Lighting one up like I used to. Dancing all alone like I used to. Giving it up like I used to. Falling in love like I used to. . Open my heart like I used to. Making out long like I used to. Holding hands openly, rights to. Taking what's mine like I used to. . [Outro: Sharon Van Etten & Angel Olsen]. Like I used to (like I used to). Like I used to (like I used to)Embed
