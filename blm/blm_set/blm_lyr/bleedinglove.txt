Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain. Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain. Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen. But somethin' happened for the very first time with you. My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true. And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm goin' crazy. . [Pre-Chorus]. But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'. You cut me open and I. [Chorus]. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. I keep bleedin'. I keep, keep bleedin' love. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. You cut me open. . [Verse 2]. Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud. Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt. Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin'. But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace. And in this world of loneliness, I see your face. Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm goin' crazy. Maybe, maybe. . [Pre-Chorus]. But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'. You cut me open and I. . [Chorus]. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. I keep bleedin'. I keep, keep bleedin' love. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. You cut me open. You might also like[Bridge]. And it's drainin' all of me. Though they find it hard to believe. I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see. . [Pre-Chorus]. I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'. Ooh, you cut me open and I. . [Chorus]. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. I keep bleedin'. I keep, keep bleedin' love. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. Ooh, you cut me open and I. . [Chorus]. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love. I keep bleedin' (Oh). I keep, keep bleedin' love. Keep bleedin' (I keep...). Keep, keep bleedin' love. Ooh, you cut me open and I. Keep bleedin'. Keep, keep bleedin' love31Embed
