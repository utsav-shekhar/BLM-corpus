Let's find words to tear these walls down. And I threw them all away. If I start then I probably won't stop. 'Cause the world moves on and the lights stay on. For the next one, and next one, it's an ocean. No, I don't wanna waste forever. But I can if I want to. There's so much that can change my mind.
