The soul of an animal. Deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots. No need for mechanical. I come strictly organical. When I need to feast, I look to the East. That's why I'm never scared of the beast. Even though they try to prey upon me. I'm protected by the one always greater than me. So now I reveal to thee. Because you wanna see. The contour of my mystery. The strength of my arches. The colour of my conscience. And the way that I process my diction. Some fact some fiction some mystery. Some future fantasy. I'm the trunk that holds the branches. The leaves who do the dances. My flowers romantic. My love gigantic. From Africa, transplanted translantic. In the heat of the sun. I bring shade for everyone. Like the beat on the one. I'm the skin on the drum. (chorus). I keep on living with the fullness of the one. Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum. . I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire. So you can fire one. Fire one. Fire two. . See I've been fully marinated. And now I'm ready for the fire. See I'm beginning to perspire. From deep within to the skin. Yo, the feminine and the masculine. The pieces of the puzzle. See my reflections in the puddle. After the storm the purple of the sky. Brings to mind another time. When we resided. Below the water line. Life was fine there human divine. But in the years following. Evil men came swallowing. Everything in sight. Some learned to run, some stayed to fight. I kneeled at the tomb of the soldier. Said I would love to behold her. The magic in store there. She touched me on the shoulder. She said, "in time all is revealed, box of light be unsealed. Now listen to me son, be like the skin on the drum". You might also like(chorus). And as the pepper gas clears. And police and protestors go home. Just as the morning dew are tear drops of the night. My emotions are always there for you. And will never leave you dry. Bless. . Michael Franti And Spearhead LyricsEmbed
