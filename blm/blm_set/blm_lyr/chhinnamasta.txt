I can't fucking breathe. The grass is all dead, but I'm choking on the weeds. Fruit decaying in the trees. Rotting branches swaying gently in the breeze. . [Chorus]. Drain me of my sanity. I can't fucking breathe. Pray for me. I can't fucking breathe. [Verse 2]. We are drowning in the lake. We are drowning in the lake. A hovering wasteland devoid of time. A cancer magnet breaking down reality. We are rotting, hopelessly unaware of our nonexistence. . [Chorus]. Drain me of my sanity. I can't fucking breathe. Pray for me. I can't fucking breathe. . [Verse 3]. I never made a promise I could keep. I close my eyes and pretend to sleep. We're only biding our time. Barely clinging to life, I'm fucking dying inside (I'm dying inside). Pray for me. . [Outro]. A gaping wound. Bleeding darkness into absolution. Infecting actuality. Living a constant painless death. A collection of husking corpses. Destined to stride along in eternal ignoranceYou might also like1Embed
