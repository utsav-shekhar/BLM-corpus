To save my soul?. . Luke Skywalker: No.. . [they draw their lightsabers and fight]. . Luke Skywalker: I failed you, Ben. I'm sorry.. . Kylo Ren: I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead, the war is over, and when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi!. . Luke Skywalker: Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi.. . Kylo Ren: I'll destroy her. And you. And all of it.. . Luke Skywalker: No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father.. . Kylo Ren: The Empire, your parents, the Resistance, the Sith, the Jedi... let the past die. Kill it, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you are meant to be.. . . Snoke: [to Kylo Ren] You are no Vader. You are just a child in a mask.. . Luke Skywalker: What do you know about the force?. .

Darkness. A balance.. . Luke Skywalker: It's so much bigger.. . . [R2-D2 beeps]. . Luke Skywalker: Hey, sacred planet. Watch the language!. . Snoke: Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child. He ignites it, and kills his true enemy!. Poe Dameron: Permission to hop in an X-Wing and blow something up?. Leia Organa: Permission granted.. . . Poe Dameron: [watching Luke facing Kylo Ren] He's doing this for a reason. He's stalling so we can escape.. . Finn: Escape? He's one against an army. We have to help him, we have to fight.. . Poe Dameron: No, no. We are the spark that'll light the fire that'll burn the First Order down.. . . Luke Skywalker: I've seen this raw strength only once before in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.. . Kylo Ren: Do you know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? You've just hidden it away. Say it.. . Rey: [in tears] They were nobody.. . Kylo Ren: They were filthy junk traders. Sold you off for drinking money. They're dead in a pauper's grave in the Jakku desert. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me.. . . Luke Skywalker: What do you see?. . Rey: The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.. . Luke Skywalker: And between it all?. . Rey: Balance and energy. A force.. . Luke Skywalker: And inside you?. . Rey: Inside me, that same force.. . Captain Phasma: You were always scum.. . Finn: Rebel scum.. . . Poe Dameron: You must have a thousand questions.. . Finn: Where's Rey?. . . Poe Dameron: She drew them off! All of them!. . Finn: Ah they hate that ship!. .

He laughs] Ah, Skywalker. Missed you, have I.. . Luke Skywalker: So it is time for the Jedi Order to end.. . Yoda: Time it is for you to look past a pile of old books, hmm?. . Luke Skywalker: The sacred Jedi texts?. . Yoda: Oh, read them, have you? Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmm? The need in front of your nose.. . Luke Skywalker: I was weak. Unwise.. . Yoda: Lost Ben Solo you did. Lose Rey we must not.. . Luke Skywalker: I can't be what she needs me to be.. . Yoda: Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength. Mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.. . . Rey: I know this place.. . Luke Skywalker: Built a thousand generations ago to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion. You've seen this place. You've seen this island.. . Rey: Only in dreams.. . . Luke Skywalker: This is not going to go the way you think!. . .

Leia Organa: Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio.. . C-3PO: Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General. Nervous?. . . Leia Organa: [slaps Poe Dameron] You're demoted.. . . Leia Organa: Hope is like the sun. If you only believe it when you see it you'll never make it through the night.. . . Kylo Ren: You're nothing. But not to me. . Snoke: You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo.. . . Poe Dameron: This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet, I have an urgent communique for General Hugs.. . General Hux: This is General Hux of the First Order. The Republic is no more. Your fleet are Rebel scum and war criminals. Tell your precious princess there will be no terms, there will be no surrender.... . Poe Dameron: Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.. . General Hux: This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed. We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.. . Poe Dameron: Okay. I'll hold.. . General Hux: Hello?. . Poe Dameron: Hello? Yup, I'm still here.. . General Hux: Can he hear me?. . Poe Dameron: Hugs?. .
