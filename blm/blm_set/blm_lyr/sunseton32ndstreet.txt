When they broke down the door and put their guns in the face of your wife and child. And as they pinned you to the floor, did you say, "Officer, I am not resisting you?". . [Chorus]. American justice, American dream. Is this what "the other half" means?. Half of our lives dissolved in fear. Half our rights, they disappear. Is our apathy so corrosive?. Where does the cycle start?. Hear the sirens screaming out in the distance. Hold your family close to your heart. American justice, American lies. A war of words that I despise. I wish the good cops, if they exist. The very best, and a bullet for all the. Complications, injustice. Deliberations, what's the deal?. They fake it, we break it. And take back what they steal. [Post-Chorus]. We could rise, black and white. Unbound, and make them pay. Every tear, for every fear. Defend our yesterdays. We could rise, black and white. And make them pay. For every tear, for every fear. Defend our yesterdays. . [Verse 2]. When they dropped the bomb on the building to kill a movement. Did they care where the rights of the murdered went?. Police terror in the eyes of the children. Police terror in the streets of every town. So where's our freedom when the sun goes down?. And will the houses that the landlords built keep out the bullet sounds?. . [Chorus]. American justice, American lies. A racist prison, anesthetized. I wish the good cops, if they exist. The very best, and a bullet for all the. Complications, injustice. Deliberations, what's the deal?. They fake it, we break it. And take back what they steal. You might also like[Post-Chorus]. We could rise, black and white. Unbound make them pay. For every tear, for every fear. Defend our yesterdays. We could rise, black and white. And make them pay. For every tear, for every fear. Defend our yesterdays. . [Bridge]. So they broke down the door and put their guns in the face of your wife and child. And as they pinned you to the floor, did you say, "Officer, I am not resisting you?". . [Chorus]. American justice, American dream. Is this what "the other half" means?. Half of our lives dissolved in fear. Half our rights, they disappear. Is our apathy so corrosive?. Where does the cycle start?.

We could rise, black and white. Unbound, and make them pay. For every tear, for every fear. Defend our yesterdays, go!. We could rise, black and white. And make them pay. For every tear, for every fear. Defend our yesterdays. . [Outro]. If we try, yeah, we try. If we try, yeah, we try to defend. Together, together. Together, together. Defend our yesterdays. Together, together. Defend our tomorrows. Together, together. Defend our yesterdays. Together, together. Defend our tomorrows. Together, togetherEmbed
