I learned back when I was young. Be who you are and know where you're from. And we ain’t got to be just alike. Not everything is black or white. . [Chorus]. All guitars don't sound the same. Can't judge whiskey by the bottle. It might go against the grain of that country boy motto. Sometimes what you get ain’t always what you see. All fields ain't corn, and all tractors ain't green. [Verse 2]. Kind of like the cover in a book. I might sound a little different than I look. And I ain't afraid of standin' out. And after all these years yeah I know now. I know now that. . [Chorus]. All guitars don't sound the same. Can't judge whiskey by the bottle. It might go against the grain of that country boy motto. Sometimes what you get ain't always what you see. All fields ain’t corn, and all tractors ain’t green. No, no. All tractors ain't green. All tractors ain’t green. All guitars don't sound the same. Can't judge whiskey by the bottle. . [Bridge]. We ain't gotta be just alike. And not everything is black or white. Oh yeah. . [Chorus]. ’Cause all guitars don't sound the same. Can't judge whiskey by the bottle. It might go against the grain of that country boy motto. Sometimes what you get ain't always what you see. All fields ain't corn, and all tractors ain't green.
