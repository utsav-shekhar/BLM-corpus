Have you ever asked yourself where the world is inside the solar system?. Like, where are we?. Like, where does the planet sit amongst all the stars?. Who knows, it's a super brain freeze. But an easier question than that is to ask yourself. Where we sit in the sea of art history. Like, that's tangible, that's man-made. Man-made art, so the history of it, we fit in. Another like, sort of framework to dwell on is, like, where do we live?. You know, you live in a house. I guarantee the house that you grew up in is what you define as a house. But, for someone that grew up on the opposite side of the world. What they grew up in, they think of as a house. A kitchen, a living room, a roof, a door, etcetera. Just shit to think about, you know. Whole bullet point is, the world inside it is man-made. It's all metaphoric, man has flaws. Man loves power, everything is man-made. And, what's more dangerous than that?. But, as I digressYou might also likeEmbed
