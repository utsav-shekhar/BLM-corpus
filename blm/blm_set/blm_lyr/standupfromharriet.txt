I been walkin' with my face turned to the sun. Weight on my shoulders, a bullet in my gun. Oh, I got eyes in the back of my head just in case I have to run. I do what I can when I can while I can for my people. While the clouds roll back and the stars fill the night. . [Chorus]. That's when I'm gonna stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going to a brand new home. Far across the river. Can you hear freedom calling?. Calling me to answer. Gonna keep on keepin' on. I can feel it in my bones. [Verse 2]. Early in the mornin' before the sun begins to shine. Gonna start movin' towards that separating line. I'm wading through muddy waters, you know I got a made-up mind. And I don't mind if I lose any blood on the way to salvation. And I'll fight with the strength that I got until I die. . [Chorus]. So I'm gonna stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going to a brand new home. Far across the river. Can you hear freedom calling?. Calling me to answer. Gonna keep on keepin' on. . [Bridge]. And I know what's around the bend. Might be hard to face 'cause I'm alone. And I just might fail, but Lord knows I tried. Sure as stars fill up the sky. . [Chorus]. Stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going to a brand new home. Far across the river. Can you hear freedom calling?. Calling me to answer. Gonna keep on keepin' on. I'm gonna stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going to a brand new home. Far across the river. Do you hear freedom calling?. Calling me to answer. Gonna keep on keepin' on. I'm gonna stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going to a brand new home. Far across the river. I hear freedom calling. Calling me to answer. Gonna keep on keepin' on. I can feel it in my bones. You might also like[Outro].
