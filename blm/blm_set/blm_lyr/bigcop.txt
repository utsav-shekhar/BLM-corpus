Mama ran the family grocery store. Ran a little card game through the pantry door. And every night as Papa snored. She would deal to the boys. He busted in the place around a quarter to two (The night came). A freshly minted copper with something to prove. "This a bust, nobody move". I held my mama as she cried. . [Chorus: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I just got carried away, I couldn't help it. I try to get by all by myself. It didn't have to be this way. Got carried away. Oooh. [Verse 2: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I worked my way up from the tenement beat. Finally made detective after years on the street. But, I could never forget the way she looked at me. A fire burning in her eyes. The next time that I saw her she was all grown up (The night came). Sparkling in spangles at the Club Deluxe (He waltzed right in). Where the owner was known as king of the mob. And my showgirl she was on his arm. . [Chorus: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I just got carried away, I couldn't help it. I try to get by all by myself. It didn't have to be this way. Got carried away. Oooh. . [Verse 3: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I noticed when that copper started hanging around. Whatever he was looking for, it's not what he found. He was there on a job for the boys downtown. But that's not why he was working so hard. He never said a word, but I could see what I saw (The night came). My heart was at war in a fight to the draw (How could I win). How could I jump into the arms of the law. All I could do was keep up my guard. You might also like[Chorus: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I just got carried away, I couldn't help it. I try to get by all by myself. It didn't have to be this way. Got carried away. Oooh. . [Bridge: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. The night came (It was just a matter of time). We moved in (One night he didn't come home). The big sting (Beauty isn't a crime). We hauled them in (Why should I go it alone). The night came (It was just a matter of time). He moved in (Before I won her affection). A girl needs (So tell me is it a crime?). Protection (I offered protection). . [Verse 3: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. My gangster went up river, he was serving hard time. I didn't forget about him, but he'd never be mine. And my cop was so far from a life of crime. But one day I knew he'd stolen my heart. She loved me like the dream we had so long delayed. Then she got a little cough that wouldn't go away. She didn't tell a soul 'til it was too late. When she closed her eyes, the angels sang. [Chorus: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I just got carried away, I couldn't help it. I try to get by all by myself. It didn't have to be this way. Got carried away. Oooh. . [Chorus: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris]. I just got carried away, I couldn't help it. I try to get by all by myself. It didn't have to be this way. Got carried away. . [Refrain: Ellia Bisker & Jeff Morris, Both]. Got carried away. Got carried away. Got carried away. Carried away. Carried awayEmbed
