. Is that you my lord. Is that you my lord. Is that you my lord. Talking to my heart. . I can hear a sound / over the waters. I can hear a sound / coming on the rain. I can hear a sound / whisper on the wind. Sounds like the spirit calling out my name. It's calling to me in the morning. And it comes to me in my sleep. It tells me (hey/boy) lay down all these worthless things. And let me give you something you can keep. (trade me in for). . Did you wear a crown / was the devil laughing. Did you wear a crown / and was the curtain torn. Did the thunder pound / and did heaven look away. Did you wear a crown and was it made of thorns. . Chorus. . Lord did you go down / and take on the devil. . Lord did you go down / to hell for the key. Buried in the ground / and then did you rise up. Did you go down to hell and back for me. . Is that you my lord / walking on the water. Is that you my lord / knocking at the door. Is that you my lord / calling us to follow. Calling us to follow you forevermoreYou might also likeEmbed
