Bring it!. . [Verse 1]. My life is perfect—so you believe. Are you that stupid? 'Cause I strongly disagree. I'm not a martyr—more like a thief. Your rules are twisted, and they don't affect me. . You saw me comin'—so why you runnin'?. What's the matter? It's just little old me. I know your kind—you're fuckin' blind. I give a shit—don't give a shit about anything. [Chorus]. There ain't nothin' in this world for free. There's not a man—not a man I believe. Give a rat's ass what you think about me. I'll dot your eyes and cross your fuckin' teeth (Bring it!). . [Verse 2]. You're just a trend—it's gotta end. I stand in place while you motherfuckers bend. You own a clock? Your time is up. You bottom feeders, it's just time to give up. Ready to throw down—this is a showdown. You get the memo? 'Cause it's all about to go down. I know I'm twisted—I can't resist it. I give a shit—don't give a shit about anything. . [Chorus]. There ain't nothin' in this world for free. There's not a man—not a man I believe. Give a rat's ass what you think about me. I'll dot your eyes and cross your fuckin' teeth (Bring it!). . There's nothin' in this world for me. I gave away, gave away fuckin' everything. This is the man that I'm choosing to be. I'll dot your eyes and cross your fuckin' teeth (Bring it!).

It's the size of the fight in the dog. . Yeah, bring it!. . [Chorus]. There ain't nothin' in this world for free. There's not a man—not a man I believe. Give a rat's ass what you think about me. I'll dot your eyes and cross your fuckin' teeth (Bring it!). . There's nothin' in this world for me. I gave away, gave away fuckin' everything. This is the man that I'm choosing to be.
