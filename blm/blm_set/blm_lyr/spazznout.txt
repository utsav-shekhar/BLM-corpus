Dior heavy when I drip sucka. Spooky menace it gets scary when it's tense sucka. . [Verse 1: ZEUS STUNNA]. I can’t even tell you where to start, how to begin. I been working double time its like I had a twin. But I came with Butta, so I guess that made me twice. Right after came Gutta man this shit kinda my life. Right after came Poodie man I swear that n***a my heart. I got so many siblings man that’s why i go this hard. Tear the roof off quick. Man I had to spazz out in this mothaf***a. I'm so hot. Had to burn the fan out in this mothaf***a. Addies rushed them hours got a n***a feeling like Chris tucker. Talking like a b****, might as well make your lips pucker. Fendi for my fetish. Dior heavy when I drip sucka. I'm a spooky menace it gets scary when it's tense sucka. [Chorus]. I cause a casualty. When I get mad. I get in it. I get in it. I get in it. And I don’t. And i don’t stop with no goal when I’m in it. Im gone finish. Im gone finish. Im Gone finish. Yea yea yea. . [Verse 2: GIOMANI]. She want me to beat it, i might turn her Tina. She gone call her man and let him come and clean up. Always do the most sometimes I wanna leave her. Make her hit them notes I turn her to Selena. Quentin Tarantino we gon' make a movie. Naked on the floor I tell her bring it to me. She played hard to get and now she scared to loose me. Mansions in the hills she turned into a groupie. . [Chorus]. I cause a casualty. When I get mad. I get in it. I get in it. I get in it. And I don’t. And i don’t stop with no goal when I’m in it. Im gone finish. Im gone finish. Im gone finish. Yea yea yea. You might also likeI cause a casualty. When I get mad. I get in it. I get in it. I get in it. And I don’t. And i don’t stop with no goal when I’m in it. Im gone finish. Im gone finish. Im Gone finish. Yea yea yea. . [Verse 3: POPOFF]. B****es on my mind they from Encino. Swervin’ through the night smell like Margaritas. I can’t get pulled over I might lose my Visa. I paint up her face make her Mona Lisa. Cabernet  sip it by the Liter. Jet Stream, speak French wanna know the lingo. She spread her legs, she feel like a ballerina. Private Jet, I might fly her to Ibiza. . [Bridge: POPOFF]. I cause a casualty. But When Im mad. I get in it. I get in it. I get in it. Woah oooh. And i don’t stop with no goal when I’m in it. I can  finish. I can finish. I can finish. Woah oooh. [Chorus]. I cause a casualty. When I get mad. I get in it. I get in it. I get in it. And I don’t. And i don’t stop with no goal when I’m in it. Im gone finish. Im gone finish. Im Gone finish. Yea yea yea4Embed
