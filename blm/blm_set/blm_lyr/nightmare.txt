Just sleep, just dream. Just sleep, just dream. Just sleep, just dream. . [Verse 1]. In the back of my mind. I've been trying to chase a monster this whole time. But I couldn't see the monster was me. And no one heard our cries. Now I've run out of tears. The time has come for me to disappear. Get me out of this mess and away from this stress. Set me free so I can rest. [Chorus]. We're only kids who lost our way. But if we wait long enough, we will be saved. Just sleep, just dream. This isn't fair, no, we're not just what we seem. We want to fly but our souls are trapped inside. It's not a game, not to blame, we're forced to hide. Just sleep, just dream. It's only a nightmare and soon, we'll be set free. (And soon, we'll be set free). . [Verse 2]. And I've been crying out for help. I know I bite but I mean well. Can you see my disguise? I'm different inside. Can you break this spell?. And all the ghosts from before. They're knocking and they're breaking down your door. So please, set us free, now you have the key. 'Cause I can't take the pain no more. . [Chorus]. We're only kids who lost our way. But if we wait long enough, we will be saved. Just sleep, just dream. This isn't fair, no, we're not just what we seem. We want to fly but our souls are trapped inside. It's not a game, not to blame, we're forced to hide. Just sleep, just dream. It's only a nightmare and soon, we'll be set free.
