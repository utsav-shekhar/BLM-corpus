Thoughts in my head don't disappear. I was a maybe (A maybe). That made you the truth. [Refrain]. In time I will come to see it for how it really was. In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, “Love you”. If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke. And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home. But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down (Down). And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now. Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now. . [Sample]. 何かが消えてしまったという感覚だけが、目覚めてからも、長く、残る. . [Verse]. Touch me and slip away. I can't hide feeling out of place.
