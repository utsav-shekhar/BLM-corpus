Because you asked me to. Up over the clouds. Where the sky was blue. See all around me. Every, everywhere. I could see all around me. Every, everywhere. . Sometimes, I feel like. I've never been nothin' but tired. And I'll be workin', workin'. 'Til the day I expire. Sometimes, I lay down. No more can I do. Then I go on, on again. Because you ask me to. Some days, I look down. And I'm afraid I will fall. And though the sun shines. I see nothin' at all. Then I hear your sweet voice. Oh, come and then go. Just tellin' me softly. You love me so. . The peaceful valley. Just over the mountain. The peaceful valley. Few come to know. I may never get there. Ever in this lifetime. Sooner or later. It's there I will go. Sooner or later. It's there I will goYou might also like1Embed
