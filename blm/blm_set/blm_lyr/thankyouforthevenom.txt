. [Intro]. Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal. And you never had a chance. Love it or leave it, you can't understand a pretty face. But you do, so carry on, and on, and on. . [Verse 1]. I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me. I'm just the way that the doctor made me. On, and on, and on, and on. Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door. What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?. [Pre-Chorus]. You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve. Give me a reason to believe. . [Chorus]. So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills. And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill. You're running after something that you'll never kill. If this is what you want, then fire at will. . [Verse 2]. Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?. I keep a gun on the book you gave me. Hallelujah, lock and load. Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son. It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one, and one, and one, and one. . [Pre-Chorus]. You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve. Give me a reason to believe. . [Chorus]. So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills. And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill. You're running after something that you'll never kill. If this is what you want, then fire at will. You might also like[Guitar Solo]. . [Pre-Chorus]. You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve. You wanna follow something, give me a better cause to lead. Just give me what I need, give me a reason to believe. . [Chorus]. So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills. And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill. You're running after something that you'll never kill.
