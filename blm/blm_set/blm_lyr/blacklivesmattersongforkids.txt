Driver: I don't understand. Cop: You got that, you can't have this obstructing your view. Driver: What!? Come on, are you serious?. Cop: Yup, I'm serious. Driver: For my.... Cop: Yeah, you can't have that there. Driver: For my air fresheners?. Cop: Yup. Driver: I can't have this here?. Cop: Absolutely not. Driver: That is crazy! That's the reason why you pulled me over?. Cop: Yup. Driver: You're bored, I could tell you're bored. Have a good day, man. Have a good day, sir. [Verse 1: J-Formz]. Do I think the world needs cops? Sure, why not?. But stealin peoples monеy for victimless crimes gotta stop. You tellin mе if I smoke weed, it could ruin my life. It's for my own good, that's what they tellin you right?. It's MY life, if it's what I wanna do, and I smoke. Then puttin me in jail for it won't ruin it though!?. I'm on the road that I paid to be on. In MY car, that I own, but YOU'RE rules, so, who's street are we on?. If I'm speeding, speed after me, or start a chase. And your excuse for all this is: "To keep people safe"?. How does this make sense, son? I do not know. And the outcome is I owe YOU money!? You got jokes. That car could've been speedin cause it needed to. But, you pulled them over when they actually needed you. But you gon' write the ticket though, cause you got too much pride. And make a dude sit there while his grandmother dies. Don't think I'm makin up lies, the shit I'm sayin is fact. You could look it up, but shit, why would you wanna do that!? Humans givin humans power, they're abusin it too. Takin away people's freedom for shit that they used to do. So lemme put it like this if you still ain't sold:. Morality is doin what's right, no matter what you're told. Obedience is doin what you're told, no matter what is right. And you expect me to respect someone who lives this life!?. Come on.... You might also like[Chorus: Sample of police body cam video]. Cop: That's not him, he's not a black guy. Yeah, you don't look like the person, so it's ok now, OK?. Mexican driver: But I have my baby. I have my baby.... Cop: Hey, there's an infant in that car!. **Infant screaming from being attacked by dog**. Cop: It's ok, baby. Obviously he's not connected to this, can we let him go?. . [Verse 2: J-Formz]. It went from "Protect and serve" to "Comply, or die". Shit's startin to get ridiculous, don't even try to lie. "Let's go, let us in!" (Why?). "So we can protect you from what we'll do to you if you don't let us in!". Runnin up on people's stoops. Kickin doors down, "Oh, wait, wrong house, now what?" "Fuck it, son, oops!". Shootin guns around babies cause you're scared of a dog!?. A person's life ain't worth it right? That's what the tasers are for.... There's cops that rape little kids. Officer of the year for 3 short months, then, showed women what rape really is. Ya'll pickin winners for real. Got a badge? It's a free pass for you to carry guns, kidnap, and you steal. You eat, sleep, piss, bleed, you're a human. But passin a test gave you a pass to just do what you're doin!?. Why would you pick a homeless man to abuse!?. I'm not with it, did I sign up for this shit? Because I'm kinda confused. I didn't ask for your protection, I don't need it, ain't worth it. I don't need a person to protect me from another person. Half the shit they ask you to do, you don't have to do. But if you don't, and they don't like it, then that sucks for you. Rippin kids out of cars, slammin em on their face. You ain't a hero, you're a piece of shit, a fuckin disgrace. This is the standard now. You might get brain damage if you don't feel like makin your window roll all the way down.... You know?. [Chorus: Sample of police body cam video]. Cop: Hey, what I told you!? I done told you this the other day!. **Students arm gets snapped in half**. Student: Ahhh! MY ARM! AHHH!!! AHHH!!! AHHH!!! AHHH!!! MY ARM BROKE!. Cop: Calm down, yo. Student: AH, LET ME GO!!! Let me go! Ah!!!. . [Verse 3: J-Formz]. Ruled by wolves, we're a nation of sheep. And we're run by pigs who claim they're keepin the peace. In just the past year, 2 people got arrested. One for feedin the homeless, and one for askin a question. How many people were jailed for fuckin growin a plant?. Don't try and collect rain water, they're sayin you can't. And there's no way to say that we caught them doin it. Cause we get in more trouble if we record them doin it. But you got cameras on red lights, I'm caught by a computer. Constitution says that I'm allowed to face my accuser. Here's an interesting fact:. They tell me "Don't break the law", it was the law if you were black, well, then you rode in the back. What if they didn't break that!? If I don't like it, then leave!?. If every1 in the past did that, then where would we be?. Did I miss somethin!?. Can't keep drugs out of jail, but turning society into one will fix somethin!?. People pissed at Welfare, "My taxes pay for you!". Let me tell me what else your taxes are payin for too. You pay the cops in your city to go and ticket you. And you're happy about this, how sick are you!?. He's takin your money twice to feed his family at home. So make some sense when you're complainin where your taxes are goin. You're brainwashed, so you probably ain't gon' like this song. It should b a whole lot harder for me to write this song. Real talk.... . [Chorus: Sample of police body cam video]. Woman filming: How bout you guys give him a break?. Cop: Shut up!. Woman filming: No, that is not right, he didn't do nothing wrong. Stop beating him, stop beating him! Come on out, Johnny. Johnny, come on out.... **Cops fire 20+ shots into Johnny's car**. Woman filming: Oh my God!!! Oh my God!!!! Oh my God!!!. . [Outro: Sample of police body cam video]. Male home resident: Please, my baby! Stef, please! Guys, this is my baby. You guys, can't touch my baby. Guys, this is my baby. Stop it, you have to calm down! Calm down. God, please help me. God, please help me. God, please help me. Cop: Hey, sit down!. Female home resident: My baby! My baby!!!. Cop: Sit down! Sit!. Male home resident: You have no warrant. They took my baby. They just took my baby.... Cop: Ilya.... Male home resident: You have no warrant. I have my two kids upstairs, you guys have no right to do this. Cop: Ilya, stop! No, stop.... Male home resident: Look what you're doing to my wife, what are you doing to my wife? You guys can't do this to my wife! I can't let you do this to my wife. Are you assaulting me, again? These men have assaulted me multiple times, they've assaulted my family, they've assaulted my wife. Please, what are you doing to my wife? Please, what are you doing to my wife!? You guys can't do this.... Cop: If you talk to us, we'll help you, OK?. Male home resident: I am talking to you, how are you helping me right now?. Cop: OK? So, relax right now. We just wanted to help you, Ilya. Male home resident: You're not trying to help me, you have no warrants, you broke into my house, you attacked my family, you attacked my wife, you attacked me. This is how you make sure we're ok? By assaulting us, pulling your guns out your holster? Come on, man...Embed
