They come from everywhere. A longing to be free. They come to join us here. From sea to shining sea. . And they all have a dream. As people always will. To be safe and warm. In that shining city on the hill. Some wanna slam the door. Instead of opening the gate. Aw, let’s turn this thing around. Before it gets too late. . [Chorus]. It’s up to me and you. Love can conquer hate. I know this to be true. That’s what makes us great. . [Verse 2]. Don’t tell me a lie. And sell it as a fact. I’ve been down that road before. And I ain’t goin’ back. . And don’t you brag to me. That you never read a book. I never put my faith. In a con man and his crooks. . I won’t follow down that path. And tempt the hands of fate. Aw, let’s turn this thing around. Before it gets too late. You might also like[Chorus]. It’s up to me and you. Love can conquer hate. I know this to be true. That’s what makes us great. . In the quiet of the night. I lie here wide awake. And I ask myself. Is there a difference I can make?. . [Chorus]. It’s up to me and you. Love can conquer hate. I know this to be true. That’s what makes us greatEmbed
