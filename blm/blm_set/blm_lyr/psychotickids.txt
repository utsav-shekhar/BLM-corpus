I see pictures in my head. A world where the suffering's dead. And they can't fight or unjustly arrest. Anybody for the color of their body. . [Chorus]. Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want. Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them. . [Verse 2]. Drop a hairdryer into my bath. Shocks like that make me laugh. It's fun to laugh when you're sad. Be happy, come on, let me be happy. [Pre-Chorus]. Why do you wanna go turn back time?. Come and take a ride in my psychotic mind. Why do you wanna go turn back time?. Come and take a ride in my psychotic mind. Why do you wanna go turn back time?. Come and take a ride in my psychotic mind. Why do you wanna go turn back time?. Why do you wanna go turn back time?. . [Chorus]. Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want. Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them. Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want. Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them. . [Bridge]. My mum thinks I'm on heroin. And my dad just thinks I'm gone. But they don't know fucking anything. Say “youth is wasted on the young”. My mum thinks I'm on heroin. And my dad just thinks I'm gone. But they don't know fucking anything. Say “youth is wasted on the young”. Wasted on the young. Wasted on the young. Wasted on the young. Wasted on the young. You might also like[Chorus]. Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want (What they want). Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them (Control them).
