Stand by to switch on. We fire on all pistons. We're singing along. But no one is listening. From dusk until dawn. We stay up to carry the flame. And when it's all said and done. In these alternate endings. When nothing is left. But the stragglers and empties. We're sleeping it off. Just to wake up and start it again. So burn the statues to the ground. Start to lay your weapons down. Bound for glory on this street. But there's a bridge out up ahead. Noise canceled , drown the signal out. Change channels, manufacture doubt. When the only thing we'll fight for every day. Is a better seat on a crashing.... Plain to see, but hard to breathe. The streets are full of tumbleweeds. . [Chorus]. And now it's morning in the streets of Amerika. But we don't go outside anymore. The radio blasts hysteria. While the television's sideways on the floor. . [Verse 2]. Under moonlit skies and surveillance. As we cheer from the stands in the stadiums. On a jumbotron we all sing along to escape. Once we were the lighthouse. To the world's most desperate ships. But what we became was a towering flame. Leading the moth right into it. Now we are waking up to the phone lines cut. You might also like[Chorus]. 'Cause it's morning in the streets of Amerika. And we don't go outside anymore. The radio blasts hysteria. While the television's sideways... on the floor. . [Verse 3]. With a teleprompter in our faces. Yeah, we don't even know what we're saying. Car that's slowly crashing. And we can't look away. Parading to the edge of the cliff now. We're trying to figure out how to get down. While the night is fast approaching. Would we even recognise our former lives in this artificial light?. . [Chorus]. Morning in the streets of Amerika. But we don't go outside anymore. There's something wrong with the stereo. And the television's sideways. We're mourning in the streets of Amerika. Mourning in the streets of Amerika. We're mourning in the streets of Amerika. Mourning in the streets of Amerika.
