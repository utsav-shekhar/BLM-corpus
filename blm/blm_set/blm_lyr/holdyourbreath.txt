And we're almost on, tonight. Hold your breath, we'll be just fine. . [Chorus: Mitchel Cave]. So tear it down like you have to. The smoke's building in my lungs. Well, goddamn, I've gotta have you. And I'm not stopping till we're done here. 'Cause I want this more than you think, dear. And this substance isn't making my head clear. And just hold your breath, now. [Verse 2: Christian Anthony]. Hold your breath, I'll give you time. With the lights down low and the tension high. And just for the night, you'll be all mine now. And that's fine with me, girl. . [Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]. And we're almost on, tonight. Hold your breath, we'll be just fine. . [Chorus: Mitchel Cave]. So tear it down like you have to. The smoke's building in my lungs. Well, goddamn, I've gotta have you. And I'm not stopping till we're done here. 'Cause I want this more than you think, dear. And this substance isn't making my head clear. And just hold your breath, now. . [Outro: Mitchel Cave].
