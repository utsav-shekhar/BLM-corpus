All the power and it's gonna take. All of our. Strength to stop them right where they stand. . They steal water poison. Sons and daughters play. Divide and conquer. Fearing what they don't understand. . We cannot listen when we're shouting onlie. It's dividing of our progress when we're so close to find. The destination where we can align. It's over when we say so and it's already time. {Chorus}. That's how it breaks. It's coming to be right now. I know I know. Good god give me just a little bit. . {Verse 2}. We can stop them we've got. More in common we gotta keep. Them from bombing. Killing in the name of their greed. I hear you and you hear me. Letting go of fear's the only way to be free. . We cannot listen when we're shouting online. It's dividing our progress when we're so close to find. The destination where can align. It's over when we say so and it's alreay time. . {Chorus}. That's how it breaks. It's coming to be right now. I know I know. Good god give me just a little bit. . {Verse 3}. Someone will dig it up maybe make em lose their piece of mind. We wanna see it come undone by the picket sign. Someone will call it out maybe when it's children caught behind. We wanna hear it tearing free from their thin blue line. I read the news today oh boy. She was a young American. Opressed by old established men. I heard the news today oh boy. He was a young American. Killed cause the colour of his skin. You might also like{Chorus}. That's how it breaks. It's coming to be right now. I know I know. Take care TCB. . That's how it breaks. It's coming to be right now. I know I know. Good god give me just a little bitEmbed
