When a father can go home to his kids and a mother loses her son. When cops aim to treat life like hunting game. What would you do? Huh?!. What would you do? Huh?!. When the world revolves around em but stops with your shade?. What would you do? Huh?!. What would you do? Huh?!. When triggers are pulled before questions are asked?. When triggers are pulled I ask. What would you do? Huh?!. What would you do? Huh?!. When the news spews the same rhetoric material. When the youth are spoon feed lies like they eating cereal. When surreal turns to realist shit you've ever witnessed. When the candle vigils look like they are normal business. When the reverend pimpin'. Y'all can't even tell the difference. When you really listen to. To them old white politicians. When they really miss the concept of a real religion. And they never blame the mindset. They just point the finger. When you got the mouth to combat. But you have no millions. And you need to find the conscious. And yet keep it triller. When the courts obey the monster. They reward the killer. When the courts neglect the Mamas. They reward the killers. When the courts obey the monster. They reward the killer. When the courts obey the monster. They reward them. What would you do? Huh?!. What would you do? Huh?!. Tell em dine on their own bullets tonight (No justice, no peace). Tell em dine on their own bullets tonight (Hey, no justice, no peace).
