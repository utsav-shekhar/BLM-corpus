. Assembled here are two playlists, and two points of view – one, a man, the other, a woman. Your playlist will be your own feelings and expression, but these can serve as inspiration and maybe remind you of the special songs you want on your own.A Man’s ViewGuys love sex almost as much as food. (Some claim they love sex even more than food, but really, they just love the thrill of the hunt for sex, and after the sex, they’ll go have some food to celebrate.) Guys also know that women secretly love bad boys, so your playlist has to convey that undertone early and often to impart a sense of danger. You just can’t do that with classical music; save that for Sunday morning. No, the best music to express that bad boy image is rock. You can go with any of its variants, from country rock to southern rock to rockabilly to punk to indie, but keeping an edge to it will serve you well.. . The playlist must have four parts too:Flirtation – Sets the mood for romanceSeduction – Lets her know she’s the only one you desireSurrender – Helps her release her inhibitions and beg you for the coup de grâceTe Amo Mi Amor– Time to express your love and fidelity.

"She's Too Good For Me" -- by Warren Zevon -- Why It's HereA Woman's View:Throughout music, we generally find the male charming the female, while the ladies are most known for their mournful breakup songs. However, this doesn't mean that women don't crave intimacy with their companions (while it lasts). A woman loves to play innocent and seduce her man through subtle implications that escalate to full-blown love. She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind, and most of all, make him feel. She voices her feelings of devotion, and most of all, her wish for her Valentine to reciprocate these feelings.A Woman's Playlist:There is no better way to beckon him than through a dance floor, be it through upbeat pop or classic jazz. Yes, even if you need to learn a mating dance like a certain species of sexy bird to get his attention, put some swing into it for V-Day. There are a number of moods you could use to get him on the stage to get the love felt:Upbeat /energetic: If he is the straight-forward type, he is likely more responsive towards a blaring and blunt track that screams "LOVE ME AND TOUCH ME!" or "I LOVE YOU SO IT'S YOUR TURN TO RECIPROCATE!"Intimate confessing: These songs are far more mellow and often contain subtle implications of what the artist really wants. The declaration of love and the invitation for it are expressed nonetheless.. . Upbeat/energetic:. "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)" --. by Whitney Houston -- Why it's Here. "Closer" -- by Tegan and Sara -- Why It's Here. "We Found Love" -- by Rihanna -- Why It's Here. "Counterfeit" -- by Meghan Linsey -- Why It's Here. "The Wire" -- by HAIM -- Why It's Here.

"She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind". - Angela Ding. Legacy schmegacy, Angela. Men know that women want commitment and security. (They have an instinctual need to nest.) Women won't have sex with men at the drop of a hat; they need to know there's a real connection and real emotion. I'll bet it was women that invented Valentine's Day idea to begin with. You ladies created a whole ritual around love itself, and then insist that we guys express our feelings. It isn't bad enough that we have to show our feelings (and thus become vulnerable to your rejection), you have to layer onto the whole thing that there be a legacy to our relationship - that we have to carry our devotion to you around with us in a sling bag, long after you're gone, to share with the next woman who comes down the pike.. . Counterpoint:. "Hi, I'm George, and I like you, but I like sex so much more, so let me seduce you with bad-boy music." If you think that's the way to a woman's heart, then bravo. Hardcore music doesn't go very far if you also want it to have those "Te Amo Mi Amor" undertones. Nice attempt at painting a bad-boy image with romantic setting, but charming women through a four-step guide of confessions just to snatch us for a bodily release is just superficial.. . If you want a one-night stand, then of course women need to mean something to the male, and being a part of him is a greater proof of devotion. What you view as "baggage" is a memory of what used to be. Or, in the male's standards, as long as the sex was great, right?About the Authors:. . Angela Ding and George Plant are regular contributors here at Genius.  As you could tell from their position statements and annotations , they role-played  stereotypical characters for this article.  Their relationship is collegial; they have no personal or romantic (or even adversarial) relationship.. . The underlying message here was that, in a relationship, we each have many sides to our personalities.  While men are often painted one way and women another, it's best to simply be ourselves. If someone finds you attractive, good for you. If you both find each other attractive, well then, maybe you've really got something there worth developing together!Featured video:.
