. We were shaking in our beds that night. There were strangers in the streets that night. Preacher cried out hell's been raised. The preacher cried out hell's been raised. Another hot Oklahoma night. Another hot Oklahoma night. The kind of night where you just sit still. The kind of night where you just don't move. We were shaking in our beds that night. We were shaking in our boots that night. Tornado hit and the roof gave way. Tornado hit and all we could do was pray. [Chorus]. How was I to know what I was to think. How was I to know what I was to feel. How am I to fake what I can't describe. How am I to face what I cannot hide. . We were looking in our hearts that day. There was movement in our hearts that day. They were talking but we could not hear. They were talking but we could not hear. Fever broke and the dead raised up. The ground broke open and the dead were raised. The kind of night where you just sit spooked. It's a hard life, it's a hard life. We were knocking in our hearts that day. We were hugging in our beds that night. Storm hit and the roof gave way. When a man cries it ain't easy. But he swore duty, body and soul. . [Chorus]. How was I to know what I was to think. How was I to know what I was to feel. How am I to fake what I can't describe. How am I to face what I cannot hide. You might also likeMomma said you know she ain't down. . We were lying in our hearts that day. We were praying in our hearts that day. We were praying but we could not feel. They were praying but we could not feel. Another hot Oklahoma night. Another Oklahoma night. Fools part as the day breaks wide. Heaven's fools who were opened wide. I quit, so I said give up. Said I can't stop the light's not gone. I met a full moon again that day. And my heart rips open and all I could do was pray. . [Chorus]. How was I to know what I was to think. How was I to know what I was to feel. How am I to face what I cannot hide. How am I to say what I cannot hideEmbed
