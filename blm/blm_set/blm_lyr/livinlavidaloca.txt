She's into superstitions. Black cats and voodoo dolls. I feel a premonition. That girl's gonna make me fall. . [Verse 2]. She's into new sensations. New kicks in the candlelight. She's got a new addiction. For every day and night. [Pre-Chorus 1]. She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain. She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain. Like a bullet to your brain, come on. . [Chorus]. Upside, inside out. She's livin' la vida loca. She'll push and pull you down. Livin' la vida loca. Her lips are devil red. And her skin's the color mocha. She will wear you out. Livin' la vida loca (Come on). Livin' la vida loca (Come on). She's livin' la vida loca. . [Verse 3]. Woke up in New York City. In a funky cheap hotel. She took my heart and she took my money. She must've slipped me a sleeping pill. . [Pre-Chorus 2]. She never drinks the water, makes you order French champagne. Once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same. Yeah, she'll make you go insane (Come on). You might also like[Chorus].
