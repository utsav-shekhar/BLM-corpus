I know you still love me. It's been a long time without you. Can't help it, FaceTimin'. All night, can't sleep, lonely. . [Pre-Chorus]. Now that you're gone, I got 20/20 vision 'bout us. Now that you're here, I can see it in another way. I just wanna feel you on me. Fuck all of that child's play. [Chorus]. This shit right here, can't get enough. Who gon' hold you down. When you're really goin' through it like me?. Who gon' see your face in a crowd?. Pick you out like me. I just wanna love ya, I just want all you. All of you, I just want all you. You all over me, yeah, yeah. I just wanna love ya, I just want all you. All of you, I just want all you. You all over me, yeah, yeah. And I know you wanna be with me. And you know I wanna be with you. Life's too short, lil' baby, fall through. . [Verse 2]. I know you picture us. Been a long time without me. Up early, made breakfast. Spend the day playing video games. . [Pre-Chorus]. Now that you're gone, I got 20/20 vision 'bout us. Now that you're here, I can see it in another way. I just wanna feel you on me.
