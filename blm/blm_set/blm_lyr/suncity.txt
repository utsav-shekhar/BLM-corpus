Ahh, sun city. Sun city. South Africa. South Africa. . [Scatting]. . [Verse 1: Run-D.M.C, Grandmaster Melle Mel & Duke Bootee, Afrika Bambaataa & Kurtis Blow, Big Youth & All rappers]. We're rockers and rappers united and strong. We're here to talk about South Africa we don't like what's going on (Tell it). It's time for some justice it's time for the truth (Speak it). We've realized there's only one thing we can do. [Chorus]. We gotta say. I, I, I, I, I, I. Ain't gonna play sun city. Oh, no, no, no. I, I, I, I, I, I. I ain't gonna play sun city. Everybody say. I, I, I, I, I, I. Ain't gonna play sun city. No, no, baby. I, I, I, I, I, I. Ain't gonna play sun city. . [Verse 2: David Ruffin, Pat Benatar, Eddie Kendrick, Bruce Springsteen]. Relocation to phony homelands. Separation of families I can't understand. 23 million can't vote because they're black. We're stabbing our brothers and sisters in the back. . [Chorus]. We're gonna say. I, I, I, I, I, I. Ain't gonna play sun city. We're gonna say. I, I, I, I, I, I. Ain't gonna play sun city.

[Verse 4: Bonnie Raitt, Ruben Blades & John Oates, Lou Reed, Bobby Womack]. It's time to accept our responsibility. Freedom is a privilege nobody rides for free.

Will someone tell me what's going on?. I, I, I, I, I, I. Ain't gonna play sun city.
