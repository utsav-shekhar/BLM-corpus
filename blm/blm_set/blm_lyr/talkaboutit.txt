If it ain’t about that life. Don’t talk to me about it. Ain’t no other way around it. I’m after the paper. I can’t live without it. I work hard, I play hard. But I sip slow. Watch as the numbers grow. I’m making my way. To the top of the throne. I’ve grown sick of this life. So hand me a knife. I sip crys, slit wrist. Deceased disease, these lazy kids. Were born to die. No wonder why I can’t survive. This way of life. Sativa devil diva smoke. Slowly creepin’ down my throat. As I lay in my Givenchy clothes. Bloody drippin’ on my toes. Sacrificial art form. We headstrong, no defeat. These white leather Raf Simons. Sneakers on my feet. Got me feeling fly. And or otherwise. I disguise. Take a hit i’m heading to the skies. Tunnel vision to these haters. Just to survive. When I arise from my sleep. In a world full of lies. [Bridge: Mean]. Watch it burn and die out. See the leaves wither. Watch the river dry out. These kids cry out. Nobody’s listening. They fail to keep an eye out. . [Hook: Mean & Azrael]. Take a flight with me. Take a hit and come fly with me. Just let it burn. . [Verse 2: Azrael]. As I watch the world turn. I'ma let the flame and the filament burn. Most of us are too concerned for. The things we yearn and the money we earn. That we be forgettin’ about the beauty of life. And the knowledge we learn. We put in this world to live and relearn. Before the day we return. Hear the voice of the voiceless cry out. Tears in the eyes may dry out. But the spirit can never die out. So carry the torch when the lights out. We start a revolution to dethrone the king. Then spark an evolution for the soul and being. Its like the holy matrimony with eternity. We cannot avoid the fact that life is too short. And death is a certainty. We dying to live but we living to die. See the minutes and seconds go by. With even the wise stilll wondering why. We search for the cure only to find that. Death is the road to awe. Even if our feet stay firm on the ground. There's always a mode to soar. Let me demonstrate how to levitate. When you put your mind to another state. If you could relate to the words I said. Then we can affirm that god is great. One day we shall return to where we came from. Rise from the ashes i’m a phoenix when I flame on. Fly high with a view from a bird’s eye. See the world through the use of the third eye. The truth will set us all free and that’s no lie. Throw myself into the flames till I know I. All praises due to the most high. Burn self = ego death = No "I". You might also like[Hook: Mean & Azrael]. Take a flight with me.
